"longDescription":"REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR presents the recent resurgence of electric vehicles as seen through the eyes of four pioneers of the EV revolution. Director Chris Paine (Who Killed the Electric Car?) has had unprecedented access to the electric car research and development programs at General Motors, Nissan, and Tesla Motors, while also following a part time electric car converter who refuses to wait for the international car makers to create the electric cars the public demands. As more models of electric cars than ever before start to arrive in showrooms and driveways across the world, Chris Paine's film offers an inspiring, entertaining and definitive account of this revolutionary moment in human transportation. REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR follows these auto makers as they race each other to create the first, best, and most publicly accepted electric cars for the new car market."}]
