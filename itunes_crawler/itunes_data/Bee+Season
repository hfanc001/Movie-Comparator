While Dave offers to come up with a plan to keep everyone's job, Jimmy brings in an efficiency expert. And though Andrea does her best to put them at ease, everyone realizes that they could be the one who's fired. Although Matthew is more than willing to find a way to prove just how efficient they are, Joe, Beth, Lisa and Catherine all quickly realize that he's likely to be the first one fired.
