"longDescription":"\"Good girl\" Mary and her domineering best friend, Hilary Faye, are starting their senior year at the top of the social food chain at American Eagle Christian High School - that is until Mary's boyfriend tells her he thinks he might be gay. When Jesus appears to her in a vision, she heeds his message to \"do everything she can to help him\" and, to her horror, she ends up pregnant. Suddenly, Mary begins to question everything she's believed in, and Hilary Faye and her devoted \"disciples\" turn against her.  As an outcast, Mary finds herself alone until she's befriended by the school's other pariahs: Hilary Faye's cynical, wheelchair-bound brother, Roland; the principal's skater heartthrob son, Patrick; and the high school's lone Jew, an exuberant rebel named Cassandra. In this sweetly subversive comedy, a group of outsiders band together to navigate the treacherous halls of high school and make it to graduation, ultimately learning more about themselves, finding faith in unexpected places, and realizing what it truly means to be Saved!."},
