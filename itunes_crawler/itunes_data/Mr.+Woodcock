"longDescription":"Billy Bob Thornton, Seann William Scott, and Susan Sarandon star in the outrageous comedy Mr. Woodcock.

Determined to prevent history from repeating itself, John sets out to stop his mother from marrying the man who made life miserable for him and his classmates. Mr. Woodcock also features a strong supporting cast including Amy Poehler (Saturday Night Live) and Ethan Suplee (My Name Is Earl).
