"longDescription":"Pink Blueprint - The Panther answers a \"Help Wanted\" sign and becomes a short-order cook in a cafe next to a building site. After repeated mishaps (pizza backed with plaster, exploding oven, etc.) and making the manager's life generally miserable, he quits, the owner puts the cafe up for sale, and we close with an irate customer chasing them both into the sunset. \r\nBomb Voyage - The Inspector attempts to rescue The Commissioner, who has been captured by aliens from outer space.        \r\nPink Tail Fly - After watching television till the wee hours, a sleepy PINK PANTHER trudges off to bed. Soon he becomes aware of a pesty fly which really begins to \"bug\" him. In the crazy antics that follow, the Panther and the fly frantically battle to see who can outdo the other, with the fly usually emerging the victor. Noticeably disturbed, the Panther resorts to Karate, but succeeds only in breaking up all the furniture while the fly escapes unscathed. In a sudden turnaround, the fly tries a few Karate tricks on the Panther and surprisingly enough, the fly's strength overwhelms the Panther who winds up outside in the rain. As the little fly contentedly settles down to watch television, a drenched PINK PANTHER knocks furiously at the window."},

This time he's pitted against Douvier (Robert Webber), a business tycoon who runs an international narcotics ring. Douvier decides that his \"dumped\" mistress, Simone (Dyan Cannon), knows far too much about his illegal enterprises and arranges for her demise. When Clouseau stumbles on the scene and accidentally saves Simone's life, she becomes his grateful accomplice. On his way to a rendezvous with Douvier, Clouseau is mugged by a transvestite, who makes off with his clothes in his car. The transvestite is the one who drives into Douvier's trap and gets blown away! Clouseau is pronounced dead. Attending his own memorial service, disguised as a priest, is Clouseau...and he's far from finished."},

"longDescription":"Pinto Pink - A weary, footsore Pink Panther is trying to thumb a ride to Los Angeles when a smart-aleck horse catches his eye, and he decides to ride the poor beast into town.  However, the ornery brute has ideas of his own and resists all of the Panther's efforts to saddle him.  When the Panther finally does get him saddled, the stubborn beast won't move.  In desperation, the Panther devises a zany scheme that quickly moves the horse, but once started there is no stopping him and all ends in catastrophe for the \"Pink Cowpuncher.\"    \r\nLe Pig-al Patrol - The Inspector tries to apprehend a vicious motorcycle gang.  \r\nIn The Pink - The physical fitness craze hits the Pink Panther, and he decides to enroll in a body beautiful school to put himself back in shape.  The school has all kinds of sophisticated equipment to work out with, but all of these seem to put the Panther more out of shape than in.  In his usual zany fashion, the Panther creates bedlam by dropping barbells on his toes, taking a wild ride on an exercycle, and winds up going through the ceiling after jumping on the trampoline.  The completely wrecked school now has to try and put itself back in shape after the pink pupil's whirlwind visit.  As for our furry friend, he becomes interested in a \"resting craze\" after all those painful exercises."},

When he is warned by his loss about arriving late, Panther decides to buy a cuckoo clock to help him wake up early. But, when the little bird does the job too well, the annoyed Panther tries unsuccessfully to get rid of him. The little bird, however, is too smart for Panther and outwits him at every turn. The two wind up becoming good friends, and Panther makes the cuckoo a little bed for him to sleep in. The fun begins again when the alarm clock blasts off the next morning, only to be smashed by the sleepy little bird. \r\nLondon Derriere - In England, where the police are unarmed, the Inspector has a hard time catching a jewel thief without the use of his gun.  \r\nThink Before You Pink - The Pink Panther is attempting to cross a busy intersection.
