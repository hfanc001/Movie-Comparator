"longDescription":"In 1795, the nineteenth year of King Jeongjo's reign, a large amount of fake silver is slipped into circulation creating a substantial threat to the economy. Detective Kim Min (Kim Myung-min) is assigned the task to investigate the crime ring behind the scheme. He goes undercover in a rural village with his best friend and sidekick, Seo-pil (Oh Dal-soo). During their investigation, the pair meets a girl called Da-hae who asks them to help her find her missing sister. Soon, Da-hae goes missing, too, and discolored, bluish corpses of village girls begin to wash up on the shore. Kim Min discovers that these deaths are directly related to the manufacturing operation of counterfeit silver."}]
