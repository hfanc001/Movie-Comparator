Will harnessing the bubble's power finally get Plankton the Krabby Patty recipe? Or will SpongeBob's bubble skills save the day? Then, the horrors continue when Plankton sabotages SpongeBob's trusty spatula, SpongeBob's deepest secrets are revealed when Squidward steals a peek in his personal diary, Patrick wreaks havoc throughout Bikini Bottom when he becomes wannabe super hero, Patrick Man, and SpongeBob is sent back to school to renew his milkshake-making license.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
