"longDescription":"Eleven-year-old Toe Thompson is the designated punching bag for the bullies of the suburban community of Black Falls, where his and everyone else's parents work for Black Box Industries, makers of the do-it-all gadget that's sweeping the nation. But during a freak storm, a mysterious Rainbow Rock, which grants wishes to anyone who finds it, falls from the sky. Suddenly, the neighborhood that Toe already thinks is weird is about to get a lot weirder. As the Rainbow Rock ricochets around the town - from kid to kid and parent to parent - wishes-come-true quickly turn the neighborhood upside down in a wild rampage of everything from tiny aliens to giant boogers. From Robert Rodriguez, director of \"Spy Kids,\" comes a magical fantasy adventure told through a series of shorts that each brings to life the sometimes wonderful, often terrible, and totally out-of-control wishes that become far more than Toe and his neighbors ever imagined."},

"longDescription":"\"What happened to you last night?\" \"Umm...I don’t know.\" \"Where did you go? We waited for you for a while?\" \"I don't know...I don’t really want to talk about it.\" \"Where did you end up?\" \"F***! I said I didn't want to talk about it.... My head hurts. I'm gonna go lay down. I'll call you tomorrow.\" In December of 2008, Kanye West sent Spike Jonze his song See You In My Nightmares from 808s and Heartbreaks. They’d been talking for quite awhile about working on a project together, and it was finally a good time for both of them. Spike wrote a story for the song, working off of the raw feeling of 808s and Heartbreak. He suggested they do it as a short film, which would free them up creatively, and Kanye agreed. Spike, knowing Kanye’s level of commitment, cast him as the lead character – a pathetic, sad drunk in a club. Spike wanted to get a raw, shameless performance, and Kanye went for it, wholeheartedly. They filmed it over the course of two days at a club in West Hollywood, with a very low budget and a skeleton crew. It became an experimental short film for them. Spike says, “Our idea was just to see if we could make a short film, pay for it ourselves, put it on iTunes, and see what happens.”"},
