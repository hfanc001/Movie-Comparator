"longDescription":"Three generations of top actresses - two-time Academy Award® winner Jane Fonda, Lindsay Lohan and Felicity Huffman - unite in a film from director Garry Marshall about the power of redemption, freedom in forgiveness and the unbreakable bonds of motherhood. When Lilly (Huffman) can no longer handle her rebellious teenage daughter, Rachel (Lohan), she takes her to the one place she swore she'd never return… her mother's house. For one very surprising summer, these three very different women are living under one roof and under one rule: Georgia's (Fonda)."},

"description":"Pat was a beautiful, willful child whose family belonged to the upper crust of Georgia society. Little Pat's parents adored their daughter and satisfied her every desire. But as Pat grew older, her pampered life took a twisted turn when she found that her beauty and spoiled demands were not enough. Now, to get everything she ever wanted, she would resort to lying, deception, robbery - and worse.<br /> Ann Rule uses her characteristic insight and exclusive access to the facts to create a gripping portrait of that rarity in crime: a female sociopath."},
