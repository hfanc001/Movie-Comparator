"longDescription":"It was the last days of LCD Soundsystem - one of the most celebrated bands of its generation. On April 2nd, 2011, the band played its final show at Madison Square Garden. New York Magazine called the concert “a marvel of pure craft” and TIME magazine lamented “we may never dance again.” SHUT UP AND PLAY THE HITS documents this once-in-a-lifetime performance and also reveals an intimate portrait of band leader James Murphy as he navigates the ramifications of his decision to end LCD Soundsystem."}]
