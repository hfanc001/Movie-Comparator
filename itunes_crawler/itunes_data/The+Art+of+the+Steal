"description":"In his celebrated best seller Catch Me If You Can, Frank Abagnale recounted his youthful career as a master imposter and forger. In <i>The Art of the Steal<\/i>, Abagnale tells the remarkable story of how he parlayed his knowledge of cons and scams into a successful career as a consultant to businesses on preventing financial foul play - while revealing to listeners how they can identify and outsmart perpetrators of fraud.<br />\nTechnology may have made it easier to track down criminals, but cyberspace has spawned a skyrocketing number of ways to commit crime - much of it untraceable. In fact, Frank Abagnale has discovered that punishment for fraud, much less recovery of stolen funds, is a rare occurrence. Prevention is the best form of protection. Drawn from his early years of experience as an ingenious con artist (whose check scams alone mounted to more than two million dollars in stolen funds) and his 25-year career on the other side of the law, <i>The Art of the Steal<\/i> provides eye-opening stories of true scams, with tips on how they could have been avoided."},

"description":"President-elect Donald J. Trump lays out his professional and personal worldview in this classic work—a firsthand account of the rise of America's foremost deal-maker. <br /><br />\"I like thinking big. I always have. To me it's very simple: If you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.\" —Donald J. Trump <br /><br />Here is Trump in action—how he runs his organization and how he runs his life—as he meets the people he needs to meet, chats with family and friends, clashes with enemies, and challenges conventional thinking. But even a maverick plays by rules, and Trump has formulated time-tested guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest accomplishments; he shatters myths; he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-maker's art. And throughout, Trump talks—really talks—about how he does it. <i>Trump: The Art of the Deal<\/i> is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur—the ultimate read for anyone interested in the man behind the spotlight. <br /><br />Praise for <i>Trump: The Art of the Deal<\/i> <br /><br />\"Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again.\" —<i>The New York Times<\/i> <br /><br />\"Donald Trump is a deal maker. He is a deal maker the way lions are carnivores and water is wet.\" —<i>Chicago Tribune<\/i> <br /><br />\"Fascinating . . . wholly absorbing . . . conveys Trump's larger-than-life demeanor so vibrantly that the reader's attention is instantly and fully claimed.\" —<i>Boston Herald<\/i> <br /><br />\"A chatty, generous, chutzpa-filled autobiography.\" —<i>New York Post<\/i>"},

"description":"This audiobook is an insightful journey about a man's life and how he achieved great success in his career up until that point. Donald Trump was a young entrepreneur entwined in many controversies, but knew (and still knows) how to use these controversies to his own benefit. He has always been skilled at living large and doesn't take no for an answer. This audiobook gives you inside knowledge and inspiration on how to make a deal successfully. This audiobook is actually more of an autobiography than a \"how to\" or self-help audiobook. It is an interesting view of the past, a long look at the mogul on his way to becoming America's most famous businessman. <br /><br />This is a boastful, boyishly disarming, thoroughly engaging personal history, which offers an inside look at aspects of financing, development, and construction in big-time New York real estate. <br /><br />Here is a preview of what you'll learn: Dealing: A Week in the Life, Trump Cards: The Elements of the Deal, Growing Up, The Cincinnati Kid: Prudence Pays, The Move to Manhattan, Grand Hotel: Reviving 42nd Street, Trump Tower: The Tiffany Location, Gaming: The Building on the Boardwalk, Wynn-fall: The Battle for Hilton, Low Rent, High Stakes: The Showdown on Central Park South, Long Shot: The Spring and Fall of the USFL, Ice Capades: Rebuilding Wollman Rink, Comeback: A West Side Story, The Week That Was: How the Deals Came Out, The Book at a Glance, Conclusion, Final Thoughts, Now What?."},

When <i>The Art of Negotiating<\/i> first appeared, it taught us that negotiation doesn't have to be an adversarial process that ends in victory for one party and defeat for his hapless rival. <br /><br />Since then, the landscape of business has changed greatly. The <i>New Art of Negotiating<\/i> provides Nierenberg's effective strategies redesigned for today's world. You will learn how to analyze your opponent's motivation, negotiate toward mutually satisfying terms, learn from your opponent's body language, and much more. Throughout, the author will guide you in successfully applying his famous win-win tactics to the bargaining process. Once, Gerald Nierenberg changed the way we think about negotiating.

Bolman and Deal's influential four-frame model of leadership and organizations - developed in their bestselling book, <i>Reframing Organizations: Artistry Choice and Leadership<\/i> offers leaders an accessible guide for understanding four major aspects of organizational life: structure, people, politics, and culture. <br /><br />Tapping into the complexity enables leaders to decode the messy world in which they live, see more options, tell better stories, and find strategies that are more effective. Case examples of leaders like Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Howard Schultz at Starbucks, Tony Hsieh at Zappos, Ursula Burns at Xerox, and the late Steve Jobs at Apple provide concrete lessons that readers can put to use in their own leadership. The book's lessons include: How to use structural tools to organize teams and organizations for better results. How to build motivation and morale by aligning organizations and people. How to map the terrain and build a power base to navigate the political dynamics in organizations.

"description":"Art today is defined by its relationship to money as never before. Prices of living artists' works have been driven to unprecedented heights, conventional boundaries within the art world have collapsed, and artists now think ever more strategically about how to advance their careers. Artists no longer simply make art, but package, sell, and brand it. <br /><br />Noah Horowitz exposes the inner workings of the contemporary art market, explaining how this unique economy came to be, how it works, and where it's headed. He takes a unique look at the globalization of the art world and the changing face of the business, offering the clearest analysis yet of how investors speculate in the market and how emerging art forms, such as video and installation, have been drawn into the commercial sphere. By carefully examining these developments against the backdrop of the deflation of the contemporary art bubble in 2008, <i>Art of the Deal<\/i> is a must-listen book that demystifies collecting and investing in today's art market."},

"description":"Negotiation is a big part of life - from buying a car or a house, taking a new job, or working out a serious conflict. Yet it's easy to believe we're usually at a disadvantage - that others are born negotiators, while we are not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Negotiation is a skill that just about everyone can learn to do well. <br /><br />Presented by a master negotiator, these 24 lectures teach you how to approach all phases of a negotiation and deal with a wide range of problems. Professor Freeman shows you how to negotiate effectively in both competitive and collaborative situations. You learn the art of handling sharp tactics, haggling, psychological traps, and other challenges, while always being \"hard on the problem and soft on the person\" - which is the key to achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. <br /><br />The course is organized around a mnemonic device, developed by Professor Freeman, that can serve in any negotiation situation. Called \"I FORESAW IT,\" this indispensable framework guides you in assembling the strongest possible case, showing you how to evaluate such factors as creative options, independent criteria, and your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Professor Freeman enriches his presentation with scores of fascinating anecdotes and case histories that vividly demonstrate what works and what doesn't when you sit down at the negotiating table."},

"description":"Trump gives great guidance on negotiating and construction deals. The book offers more inspiration than technical advice to anyone venturing into real estate.

Donald Trump also believes that one needs to seize every opportunity that presents itself. For MBA students and anyone with a passion for construction, this is a must-listen book. It gives great managerial tips. <br /><br />This is a summary and analysis of the book and not the original book. This audiobook contains a summary of the entire book, a chapter-by-chapter breakdown, and an analysis of the listening experience."},

"description":"Doing business in the post-global financial crisis (GFC) is extremely challenging for most. Traditional capital has all but dried up. This has created challenges and opportunities for business decision makers to embrace public-private partnerships in order to determine the best business climate, provide public-backed incentives to close expansion &amp; relocation projects and reduce operating and start-up costs. Running the gauntlet of getting these deals to come to fruition is tricky and full of issues that need to be addressed in order to gain access to capitalization for projects that can create jobs, increase public tax base, and assist in diversifying and rebuilding damaged local economies. <br /><br />This book is a guide to navigating this tumultuous path and assisting business leaders and economic developers in finding common ground to close new business projects and get America and other local economies around the world back into sustainable economic growth."},
