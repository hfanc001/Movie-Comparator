Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings -- In the conclusion of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, as armies mass for a final battle that will decide the fate of the world -- and powerful, ancient forces of Light and Dark compete to determine the outcome -- one member of the Fellowship of the Ring is revealed as the noble heir to the throne of the Kings of Men. Yet, the sole hope for triumph over evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood - \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" \"Everything is Illuminated\"), who, accompanied only by his loyal friend Sam and the hiddeous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power.

Wasting no time, midwife Madeleine takes action and saves his life by inserting a cuckoo-clock in place of his icy heart. And now Jack will live‚Ä¶as long as he observes three golden rules: He must never touch the hands of the clock. He must master his anger. He must never, ever fall in love. But fall in love he does, to a bespectacled young street performer, Miss Acacia, with a soul-stirring voice. Now begins a journey of escape and pursuit, from Edinburgh to Paris to Miss Acacia‚Äôs home in Andalusia. Based on the novel by Mathias Malzieu, Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart is a fantastical, wildly inventive tale of love and heartbreak ‚Äî by turns poignant and funny ‚Äî in which Jack finally learns the great joys, and ultimately the greater costs, of owning a fully formed heart."},
