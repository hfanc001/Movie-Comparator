Guided by his real-life mentor, Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley), and aided by an unlikely band of international recruits, Petit and his gang overcome long odds, betrayals, dissension and countless close calls to conceive and execute their mad plan. Academy Award® winning director Robert Zemeckis uses advanced technology in the service of an emotional, character-driven story. The Walk is a love letter to Paris and New York City in the 1970s, but most of all, to the Towers of the World Trade Center.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"From the Academy Award®-winning creators of Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo, comes this hilarious action-packed computer-animated adventure about superheroes.  Bob Paar (Craig T. Nelson) used to be one of the world's greatest superheroes (known to all as \"Mr. Incredible\"), saving lives and fighting evil on a daily basis, but now he's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and a bulging waistline.  When an unfortunate string of mishaps and frivolous law suits forced all of the legendary crime fighters to hang up their super suits fifteen years ago, Bob and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter), a famous former superhero in her own right, adopted civilian identities and retreated to the suburbs to live normal lives with their three kids.  Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment.  When he discovers the evil genius Syndrome (Jason Lee) bent on diabolical revenge is behind the mystery, his family flies to the rescue for an extraordinary battle of wits and superpowers.  Pixar Animation Studios makes technological advances in portraying human characters and stretches the boundaries of the art form with this stylish and entertaining film.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

After holding up a restaurant for quick cash, the girls head to the shore in a stolen car for what they discover is the party of a lifetime. They’re thrown in jail — but quickly bailed out by Alien (James Franco), a local rapper, drug pusher and arms dealer who lures them into a criminal underbelly that’s as lurid as it is liberating for a close-knit gang of girlfriends who are still figuring out their path. With a hallucinatory musical score by Cliff Martinez (DRIVE) and Skrillex, SPRING BREAKERS is an electrifying pop poem to girls gone wild.

The peace and tranquility he hopes to find, though, is anything but, once he agrees to being accompanied by the only person he can find willing to join him on the trek - his long lost and former friend Katz (Academy Award nominee Nick Nolte), a down-on-his-luck serial philanderer who, after a lifetime of relying on his charm and wits to keep one step ahead of the law – sees the trip as a way to sneak out of paying some debts and sneak into one last adventure before its too late. The trouble is, the two have a completely different definition of the word, “adventure”. Now they're about to find out that when you push yourself to the edge, the real fun begins.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
