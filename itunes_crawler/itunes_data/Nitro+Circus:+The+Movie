"longDescription":"Revolution Day: The Chase for the Biggest Trick in Action Sports History is the story of two amazing Nitro Circus athletes on a quest to be the first person to perform the greatest trick in the history of action sports, an astonishing quadruple back flip on a BMX bike. Revolution Day chronicles the nine month journey of the world’s best BMX riders and best friends, James Foster from Southern California and Jed Mildon a true Maori Warrior from Taupo, New Zealand. The journey begins with a countdown to the second with both riders jumping simultaneously at opposite ends of the world. But right from the opening countdown this battle was fraught with epic crashes and mind bending body failures and injuries, as these two courageous athletes somehow continued this quest despite what seemed insurmountable setbacks. Revolution Day was meant to be completed in a matter of hours but instead it stretched out over nine excruciating months! Join Jed and James and the Nitro crew for a no-holds-barred, behind-the-scenes journey of two men who prove beyond a doubt that with great courage, extraordinary determination and an unshakable belief in never giving up on your dreams, you can overcome seemingly impossible adversity, defy the odds and achieve greatness. This is a story that will make you laugh, cry, stand up and cheer and at times not be able to even look, as in the end despite both men being so incredibly deserved, only one could create history. This is the story of Revolution Day."},

"longDescription":"ROAD TO THE UNTHINKABLE: The Quest for the Motorcycle Triple Backflip (narrated by Johnny Knoxville) is the story about the attempt for the most dangerous trick in the history of action sports.  The Road to the Unthinkable recounts the progression of the motorcycle backflip.  The film tells the story of the very first competitive backflip by Carey Hart in 2000, Travis Pastrana landing his iconic double backflip at the X Games six years later, and finally the legendary quest of three men (Travis Pastrana, Thomas Pagès, and Josh Sheehan) to ride away from world’s first motorcycle triple backflip—a feat thought to be totally impossible.  This is the story of the dramatic evolution of what is possible and the athletes who risk life and limb to redefine the boundaries of human performance.  A full decade and a half after the first motorcycle backflip was attempted, the death-defying triple backflip was finally within reach. THE ROAD TO THE UNTHINKABLE follows this quest as three FMX riders and close friends push each other to the edge and back and try to write their names in the history books.   \r\nWith this release Nitro Circus doubles down on the excitement, offering two shows at one price. Also included in this very special digital bundle is, “Biggest Week in Action Sports.” A 90-minute special detailing an extraordinary seven days in spring 2015 which saw two monumental world’s firsts go down. More than 20 minutes of bonus content is also included, including Ryan “R Willy” Williams’ unbelievable world’s first triple front flip as well as episodes of the outrageous Nitro Circus digital series “Tommy and Crum” and “The AmBADASSador.”", "hasITunesExtras":true},
