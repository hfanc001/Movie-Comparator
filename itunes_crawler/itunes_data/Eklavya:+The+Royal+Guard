"longDescription":"Eklavya is the guardian of an ancient dynastic legacy whose duty is to protect the erstwhile royal family of Devigarh. However, besides guarding the blue-blooded people, Eklavya also guards a secret: he is the father of Prince Harshwardhan. Since King Jayvardhan could not impregnate his wife, it fell upon Eklavya to do the needful so that the family got an heir. The king, who hates Eklavya for this, now plots to have him murdered soon after the death of his queen. But instead, it is the king who is brutally murdered. Crestfallen that he couldn’t protect the king, Eklavya sets out to nab the killers and stumbles upon the truth behind the king’s murder and a few more bitter truths."}]
