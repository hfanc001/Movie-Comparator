"longDescription":"Halley is a young high school student who is disillusioned with love after seeing the many dysfunctional relationships around her. Her parents are now divorced and her father has a new young girlfriend she doesn't care for too much. Her mother is now always alone; and her sister is so overwhelmed by her upcoming wedding that she barely leaves the house anymore. On top of that, the shallowness of all the girls and guys at her school convinces Halley that finding true love is impossible. A tragic accident, however, leads her to meeting Macon, and suddenly Halley finds that true love can occur under unusual circumstances. Starring Mandy Moore (\"A Walk to Remember,\" \"The Princess Diaries\"), Trent Ford (\"Gosford Park,\" \"September Dawn\"), Alexandra Holden (TV's \"Friends,\" \"The Hot Chick\"), Golden Globe-winner Peter Gallagher (\"Short Cuts,\" TV's \"The O.C.\") and Emmy-winner and Golden Globe-nominee Allison Janney (TV's \"The West Wing,\" \"Juno\")."},

"description":"Does this sound like someone you know?<br />Always needs to be right. Tells you who you are and what you think. Implies that you're wrong or inadequate when you don't agree. Is threatened by people who are \"different\". Feels attacked when questioned. Doesn't seem to really hear or see you. <br />If any of the above traits sounds familiar, help is on the way! In <i>Controlling People<\/i>, best-selling author Patricia Evans tackles the \"controlling personality\" and reveals how and why these people try to run other people's lives. She also explains the compulsion that makes them continue this behavior - even as they alienate others and often lose those they love. <br /><br /><i>Controlling People<\/i> helps you unravel the senseless behavior that plagues both the controller and the victim. Can the pattern, or spell, be broken? Yes! says the author. By understanding the compelling force involved, you can be a catalyst for change and actually become a spell-breaker. Once the spell is broken and the controller sees others as they really are, a genuine connection can be forged and healing can occur. <br /><br />Should you ever find yourself in the thrall of someone close to you, <i>Controlling People<\/i> is here to give you the wisdom, power, and comfort you need to be a stronger, happier, and more independent person."},

"description":"<b>Audie Award Finalist, Business/Personal Development, 2016 <\/b><br /><br />Let's face it: We all know people who are irrational. No matter how hard you try to reason with them, it never works. So what's the solution? How do you talk to someone who's out of control? What can you do with a boss who bullies, a spouse who yells, or a friend who frequently bursts into tears? <br /><br />In his book <i>Just Listen<\/i>, Mark Goulston shared his best-selling formula for getting through to the resistant people in your life. Now, in his breakthrough new book <i>Talking to Crazy<\/i>, he brings his communication magic to the most difficult group of all - the downright irrational. As a psychiatrist, Goulston has seen his share of crazy, and he knows from experience that you can't simply argue it away. The key to handling irrational people is to learn to lean in to the crazy - to empathize with it. That radically changes the dynamic and transforms you from a threat into an ally. <br /><br /><i>Talking to Crazy<\/i> explains this counterintuitive Sanity Cycle and reveals: <br />Why people act the way they do How instinctive responses can exacerbate the situation and what to do instead When to confront a problem and when to walk away How to use a range of proven techniques including Time Travel, the Fish-bowl, and the Belly Roll And much more <br />You can't reason with unreasonable people - but you can reach them. This powerful and practical book shows you how."},

"description":"You negotiate every day of your life. Whether you are asking your employer for a raise or persuading your child to do his homework, everything is a negotiation.<br /> Written by Gerald Nierenberg, the world's foremost authority on the subject, and recognized as the Father of Contemporary Negotiation, <i>The New Art of Negotiating<\/i> is an updated, expanded version of the million-copy bestseller, <i>The Art of Negotiating<\/i>, which was the first on the subject of negotiating and introduced us all to the art of effective negotiation.<br /><br /> The Negotiation Institute which he founded, is the longest negotiation skills seminars and training in the world. When <i>The Art of Negotiating<\/i> first appeared, it taught us that negotiation doesn't have to be an adversarial process that ends in victory for one party and defeat for his hapless rival. <br /><br />Since then, the landscape of business has changed greatly. The <i>New Art of Negotiating<\/i> provides Nierenberg's effective strategies redesigned for today's world. You will learn how to analyze your opponent's motivation, negotiate toward mutually satisfying terms, learn from your opponent's body language, and much more. Throughout, the author will guide you in successfully applying his famous win-win tactics to the bargaining process. Once, Gerald Nierenberg changed the way we think about negotiating. Now, <i>The New Art of Negotiating<\/i> allows us to experience win-win success in today's business climate."},

"description":"Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a severe psychological condition that ruins relationships because a narcissist is a self-absorbed individual who only sees things one way, which is their way. In the world of a narcissist there is no room for successful relationship attributes such as mutual consideration or give or take and as a result any relationship that a narcissist is involved in is a lopsided one that solely favors the narcissist. Being involved in a relationship with a narcissist can be a difficult one, mainly because a narcissist has an unrealistic and an inflated view of themselves and suffer from a decreased ability to identify with or recognize the needs or feelings of others, so in turn the partner of a narcissist suffers. <br /><br />Do you feel that you are in a relationship with someone that suffers from the narcissistic personality disorder? Are you a narcissist yourself and would like an understanding of this personality order so that you can salvage your relationship? In his audiobook entitled <i>Narcissism Decoded<\/i> author Michael Wright explains in great detail how to identify and effectively deal with the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in your relationship. You will learn the following: <br />The characteristics of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder as well as its subtypes How to tell if you are living with a narcissist Common causes of Narcissistic Personality Disorder The problems and difficulties which can arise when in a relationship with a narcissist Important warning signs that it may be time for you to get out of a toxic relationship with a narcissist Tips for living with a narcissist Treatments for Narcissistic Personality Disorder"},
