"longDescription":"With Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst, filmmaker Robert Stone brings into sharp focus the mood of the early 1970s, a mood that inspired the formation of the first radical domestic terrorist cell to become a media sensation in the United States, the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). The SLA wreaked havoc on the West Coast and our national psyche for over two years, leaving behind a rich trove of paranoid recordings and scores of violent acts, including the kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst who would subsequently join the SLA under the alias \"Tania.\" As much as thriller as it is a document of the times, Guerrilla brings a striking, shocking moment in our nation's history back to light."}]
