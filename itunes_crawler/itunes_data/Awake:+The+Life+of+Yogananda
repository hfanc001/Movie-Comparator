"longDescription":"An unconventional biography by Oscar-nominee Paola di Florio and Sundance winner Lisa Leeman about Hindu mystic Paramahansa Yogananda who brought yoga and meditation to the West in 1920 and authored the spiritual classic “Autobiography of a Yogi,” which became the go-to book for seekers from George Harrison to Steve Jobs. By personalizing his own quest for enlightenment and sharing his struggles along the path, Yogananda made ancient teachings accessible to a modern audience. This documentary examines the world of yoga, old and new, East and West, and explores why millions today have turned their attention inwards in pursuit of Self-Realization."}]
