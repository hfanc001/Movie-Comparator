Ave Maria is content with her life of doing errands and negotiating small details - until she discovers a skeleton in her family's formerly tidy closet that completely unravels her quiet, conventional life.<br />Filled with big-time eccentrics and small-town shenanigans, <i>Big Stone Gap<\/i> is a jewel box of original characters, including sexpot Bookmobile librarian Iva Lou Wade; Fleeta Mullins, the chain-smoking pharmacy cashier with a penchant for professional wrestling; the dashing visionary Theodore Tipton; Elmo Gaspar, the snake-handling preacher; Jack MacChenseny, a coal-mining bachelor looking for true love; and Pearl Grimes, a shy mountain girl on the verge of a miraculous transformation.<br /><br />Comic and compassionate, <i>Big Stone Gap<\/i> is the story of a woman who thinks life has passed her by, only to learn that the best is yet come."},

"description":"Millions of readers around the world have fallen in love with the novels of <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Adriana Trigiani. In <i>Home to Big Stone Gap<\/i>, she tells her most powerful story yet, full of humor and heart, wisdom, and hope.<br />Nestled in the lush Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the town of Big Stone Gap has been home for Ave Maria Mulligan Machesney and her family for generations. She's been married to her beloved Jack for nearly 20 years, raised one child and buried another, and run a business that binds her community together, all while holding her tight circle of family and friends close.<br /><br /> But with her daughter, Etta, having flown the nest to enchanting Italy, Ave Maria has reached a turning point. When a friend's postcard arrives with the message \"It's time to live your life for you\", Ave Maria realizes that it's time to go in search of brand-new dreams.<br /><br />But before she can put her foot on the path, her life is turned upside down. Ave Maria agrees to helm the town musical, a hilarious reunion of local talent, past and present. A lifelong friendship collapses when a mysterious stranger comes to town and reveals a long-buried secret. An unexpected health crisis threatens her family. An old heartthrob reappears, challenging her marriage and offering a way out of her troubles. Then an opportunistic coal company comes to town and threatens to undermine the town's way of life and the mountain landscape Ave Maria has treasured since she was a girl.

"description":"<i>Milk Glass Moon<\/i>, the third book in Adriana Trigiani's best-selling Big Stone Gap series, continues the life story of Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney as she faces the challenges and changes of motherhood with her trademark humor and honesty.

Meanwhile, surprises emerge in the blossoming of crusty cashier Fleeta Mullins, the maturing of mountain girl turned savvy businesswoman Pearl Grimes, and the return of Pete Rutledge, the handsome stranger who turned Ave Maria's world upside down in <i>Big Cherry Holler.<\/i> <br /><br />In this rollicking hayride of upheaval and change, Ave Maria is led to places she never dreamed she would go, and to people who enter her life and rock its foundation. As Ave Maria reaches into the past to find answers to the present, listners will stay with her every step of the way, rooting for the onetime town spinster who embraced love and made a family. <i>Milk Glass Moon<\/i> is about the power of love and its abiding truth, and captures Trigiani at her most lyrical and heartfelt."},
