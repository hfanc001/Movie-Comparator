"longDescription":"Patricia Clarkson (Good Night and Good Luck, Miracle, The Green Mile), Peter Sarsgaard (Shattered Glass, Key, Kinsey, Garden State) and Campbell Scott (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Saint Ralph) star in this critically acclaimed tale of lust, power, corruption, betrayal and revenge set in the seductive world of the Hollywood elite. Robert Sandrich, a fledgling screenwriter (Sarsgaard) who has been living on the fringes, finds his life changed when he is offered a million dollars for his latest and most personal work The Dying Gaul, a raw, autobiographical story of the death of his lover. There is one catch the studio demands that Robert change his dead lover's character to a woman to make the story more commercially viable. Making the offer is Jeffrey (Scott), a smooth, ruthless and sexually avaricious studio executive who seduces Robert with the intoxicating Hollywood cocktail of power, money and sex. When Robert confides to Jeffrey's wife, Elaine (Clarkson) that he finds solace, both sexual and emotional, in the ghost-like world of chat rooms, the curious Elaine meets him there anonymously. As their online dialogue unfolds, she discovers that Robert and her husband are having an affair. The shock of that revelation ? and the unexpected way she responds sets off a dangerous series of deceptions, confessions and betrayals."},
