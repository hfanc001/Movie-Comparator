"longDescription":"What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? Academy Award(R)-winning writer-director Andrew Stanton (\"Finding Nemo\") and the inventive storytellers and technical geniuses at Pixar Animation Studios (\"The Incredibles,\" \"Cars,\" \"Ratatouille\") transport moviegoers to a galaxy not so very far away for a new computer-animated cosmic comedy about a determined robot named WALL-E. After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL-E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL-E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL-E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets into motion one of the most exciting and imaginative comedy adventures ever brought to the big screen. Joining WALL-E on his fantastic journey across a universe of never-before-imagined visions of the future, is a hilarious cast of characters including a pet cockroach, and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots. Filled with surprises, action, humor and heart, WALL-E was written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, co-produced by Lindsey Collins and features original and innovative sound design by Academy Award(R)-winner Ben Burtt (\"Star Wars,\" \"Indiana Jones,\" \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\").", "hasITunesExtras":true},

When Internet-generated rumors begin circulating that three of Purim's stars -- faded luminary Marilyn Hack (Catherine O'Hara), journeyman actor and former hot dog pitchman Victor Allan Miller (Harry Shearer), and ingenue Callie Webb (Parker Posey) -- may be perpetrating Award-worthy performances, a rumble of excitement rattles the cast. Once \"Hollywood Now\" anchors Chuck Porter (Fred Willard) and Cindy Martin (Jane Lynch) pick up the buzz, Award fever infects the entire production.

As does Sunfish Classics President Martin Gibb (Ricky Gervais), who suggests some last-minute changes to the film that he feels will broaden the film's appeal. Meanwhile, Purim's screenwriters, Lane Iverson (Michael McKean) and Philip Koontz (Bob Balaban) grow steadily more horrified as they watch the first film adaptation of their work diverge from their original story.

"longDescription":"A cell lives an average of 5 minutes. A hummingbird for 5 years. Right now, humans live for about 75 years. What might it mean to live forever? Director Mark Wexler embarks on a worldwide trek to investigate just what it means to grow old and what it could mean to really live forever. HOW TO LIVE FOREVER documents his journey as he seeks to learn if eternal life is possible or even desirable. Exploring these issues with a fascinating array of people—from futurist Ray Kurzweil to comedian Phyllis Diller to a 101-year-old chain-smoking marathon runner—Wexler presents a riveting series of stories and insights about youth, aging and longevity. Begun as a study in life-extension, How To Live Forever evolves into a thought-provoking, often comically poignant, examination of what truly gives life meaning."},

"longDescription":"Robin Harris' infamous \"Bebe's Kids\" come to life in this animated feature from the producers of “House Party” and “Boomerang.” They were born to be bad and they don't die, they multiply. They're not monsters... just Bebe's Kids, the irrepressible stars of a new animated feature based on the popular characters of the late comedian Robin Harris. When ladies' man Robin meets the beautiful Jamika at a funeral service, he feels he must have died and gone to heaven. But on their first date, she greets him with four small surprises: her son Leon and girlfriend Bebe's three trouble-seeking kids. Robin's dream date becomes a nightmare as the group goes to the amusement park Fun World. There, Bebe's kids - devilish daughter LaShawn, militant preteen Kahlil, and gravelly voiced toddler Pee Wee - do everything they can to spite Robin's amorous intentions... and nearly destroy Fun World in the process. With an infectious hip-hop soundtrack and the voices of Nell Carter and superstar rapper Tone Loc."},
