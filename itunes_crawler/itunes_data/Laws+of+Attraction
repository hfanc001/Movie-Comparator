"longDescription":"Though equally respected in their field, divorce lawyers Audrey Woods (Academy Award-nominee and Golden Globe-winner Julianne Moore - \"Far From Heaven,\" \"Short Cuts\"), and Daniel Rafferty (Pierce Brosnan - \"The Matador,\" \"Die Another Day\") are opposites inside and out of the courtroom. Audrey is meticulous and by the book, while Daniel relies on personality and luck to get by. Despite the difference in methods, neither lawyer has lost a case, and neither plan on ending their streak after being respectively hired by Serena and Thorne, a celebrity power couple gone wrong. The divorce settlement hinges on a particularly spectacular Irish castle, which both parties would like to keep for themselves. Audrey and Daniel hurry to Ireland with depositions in their eyes, but a growing mutual attraction manages to squirm out from beneath, and, after being immersed in a romantic Irish festival, the rival lawyers wake up married. Reeling, potentially in love (to Audrey in particular's dismay), and faced with the type of media explosion capable of leading to the end of their careers, the mismatched lawyers contemplate how to go about their clients' divorce hearings as man and wife. Also starring Golden Globe-nominee Parker Posey (\"Superman Returns,\" TV's \"Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay\"), Michael Sheen (\"Blood Diamond,\" \"The Queen\"), Frances Fisher (\"Titanic,\" \"Unforgiven\") and Nora Dunn (\"Out of Time,\" \"Bruce Almighty\")."},

"description":"This abridged audiobook presents the powerful basics of the original <i>Teachings of Abraham<\/i>. Abraham (speaking through Esther Hicks) reveals how all things, wanted and unwanted, are brought to you by this most powerful law of the universe: the Law of Attraction (\"That which is like unto itself is drawn\"). You've most likely heard the sayings \"Like attracts like\", \"Birds of a feather flock together\", or \"It is done unto you as you believe\" (a belief is only a thought you keep thinking). Although the Law of Attraction has been alluded to by some of the greatest teachers in history, it has never before been explained in as clear and practical terms as it is here.<br /> You'll learn about the omnipresent laws that govern this universe and how to make them work to your advantage. The knowledge that you'll absorb from listening to Abraham's wisdom will take all the guesswork out of daily living. You'll finally understand just about everything that's happening in your own life, as well as the lives of those you're interacting with, and you will find out how you can joyously be, do, or have anything that you desire!"},

"description":"In <i>Money, and the Law of Attraction<\/i>,&#xa0;Esther and Jerry Hicks present the teachings of the Non-Physical consciousness Abraham. The concepts offered here relate to the topic of abundance and prosperity. They will show you that you truly need to think about what you want in your life and not what you don't want. If you put your attention on thoughts of not having enough money, you are in the perfect position for the creating of more of that which you do not have. For example, when you think about something that you desire but then think about it not yet coming...and then you think about how much fun it will be to have it, but then remember that it costs a great deal of money and you cannot yet afford it...that back-and-forth thinking dilutes your passion and slows the power of your thoughts. That is, the way you are feeling is a signal from your Inner Being telling you that what you're thinking is not in harmony with what you want.<br />As Abraham says: \"There is enough for everyone. The key is for each of you is to see it and want it - and then you will attract it. Know that you have the power to bring into your life whatever you desire. Affirm that money flows to you easily and that you have an unlimited supply of abundance and prosperity\"."},

"description":"This audiobook uncovers a myriad of false premises that are at the heart of every uncomfortable relationship issue and guides you to a clear understanding of the powerful creative Vortex that has already assembled the relationships that you desire. Abraham will show you how to enter that Vortex, where you will rendezvous with everything and everyone you have been looking for.<br />Abraham says: \"It is our desire to help you to solve the mystery of those seemingly impossible relationships; to sort out the details of joyously sharing your planet with billions of others; to rediscover the beauty of your differences; and, most of all, to reestablish the most important relationship of all: your relationship with the Eternal, Non-Physical Source that is really you.<br /><br />\"It is our desire that you experience an enhanced appreciation of your planet; your body; your family; your friends; your enemies; your government; your systems; your food; your finances; your animals; your work and your play; your purpose; your Source; your Soul; your past, your future, and your present....\""},

"description":"In this recording you will discover how to utilize the law of attraction and allow the best things into your life by freeing yourself from the negative thoughts and feelings that attract the opposite of what you want.<br />The law of attraction states that whatever you think about with emotion will be drawn into your life. This law will work whether it is a wonderful and amazing life you attract or a disappointing and mediocre life.<br /><br />This recording is designed to change your core beliefs that may be stopping you from receiving the life you desire from the universe. It will help guide you to attract the life you desire in all areas, such as a fabulous home, wonderful relationships, your physical body and wellbeing, your work, and your finances.<br /><br />The quantum factor life enhancement series of recordings uses powerful natural techniques to help you make profound changes in your life, enabling you to visualize, plan, and achieve the future you want. They work by tapping into the vast natural resources available to you in your own mind. All the information is absorbed into your sub-conscious mind, while you are in a relaxed and receptive state - without any effort whatsoever. <br /><br />This program uses four techniques to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the course: Visualization, Meditation, Hypnosis and Affirmation. Their easy acceptance into your sub-conscious is ensured by the use of background alpha rhythms, which help the brain achieve a relaxed but not unconscious state. You will be aware of things around you, while being in an ideal condition to learn and retain new information. There are also theta rhythms, which help the brain to relax into a state of reduced consciousness.<br /><br />All the titles in the series, if used as suggested, will help you to change your life in ways you never dreamed of - simply by reprogramming your own self-talk and self-perception in positive ways and enabling you to achieve your full potential."},
