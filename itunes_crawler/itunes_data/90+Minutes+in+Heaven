"description":"One day Eva Piper was an elementary school teacher, the mother of three, the beloved wife of a strong, protective husband. The next day she stood at the bedside of a broken man who could do nothing but moan in agony and turn his head away from her. Later, she would learn that he had died and actually experienced heaven before being prayed back to life - a true miracle. Don Piper's testimony, told in the <i>New York Times<\/i> bestseller <i>A Walk Through the Dark: 90 Minutes in Heaven<\/i>, would one day bring hope to thousands. But all that was in the future. <br /><br />Despite family and friends who kept vigil with her, Eva Piper found herself essentially alone. Walking in the dark. And she had always hated the dark. Though it parallels that of her husband, Eva Piper's account is quite different from his. It takes listeners not to heavenly places but through a very earthly maze of hospital corridors, insurance forms, tiring commutes from home to workplace and hospital, and lonely hours of waiting and worrying. <br /><br />This is the story of a woman learning, step by darkened step, to go places she never thought she could go and growing into a person she never thought she could be. Packed with hard-earned wisdom about what it means to be a caregiver, to open yourself to the care of others, and to rest in God's provision, this book provides a dependable source of light to help you walk through the dark."},
