"longDescription":"After taking moviegoers magically into the realm of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes, the masterful storytellers and technical wizards at Pixar Animation Studios, and Academy Award®-winning director John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life), hit the road with a fast-paced comedy adventure set inside the world of cars. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, Lightning McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters –including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), and a rusty but trusty tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) – who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The all-star vocal cast also includes free-wheeling performances by Tony Shalhoub, Michael Keaton, George Carlin, Katherine Helmond, Cheech Marin, John Ratzenberger, Paul Dooley, Michael Wallis, Darrell Waltrip, racing legend Richard Petty, Jenifer Lewis and Jeremy Piven. Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) was a little monster, he’s dreamed of becoming a Scarer—and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike’s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot James P. Sullivan, “Sulley” (John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. The pair’s out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University’s elite Scare Program. With their dreams temporarily dashed, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

Bob Paar (Craig T. Nelson) used to be one of the world's greatest superheroes (known to all as \"Mr. Incredible\"), saving lives and fighting evil on a daily basis, but now he's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and a bulging waistline.  When an unfortunate string of mishaps and frivolous law suits forced all of the legendary crime fighters to hang up their super suits fifteen years ago, Bob and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter), a famous former superhero in her own right, adopted civilian identities and retreated to the suburbs to live normal lives with their three kids.  Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment.  When he discovers the evil genius Syndrome (Jason Lee) bent on diabolical revenge is behind the mystery, his family flies to the rescue for an extraordinary battle of wits and superpowers.  Pixar Animation Studios makes technological advances in portraying human characters and stretches the boundaries of the art form with this stylish and entertaining film.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

Each summer a gang of greedy grasshoppers - led by the menacing and manipulative Hopper (Kevin Spacey) - descends upon the colony to demand a hefty portion of the ants' hard-earned harvest and generally make life miserable for this peaceful community. Our hero Flik (Dave Foley), an original thinker out of step with the rest of the more traditionally-minded colony, takes it upon himself to get outside help and mistakenly enlists an unemployed troupe of bug performers from a second-rate flea circus to join the fight against the grasshoppers.

Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella’s father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother’s dying words and to “have courage and be kind.” She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella’s hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham Carter) steps forward and – armed with a pumpkin and a few mice – changes Cinderella’s life forever. A live-action feature inspired by the classic fairy tale, “Cinderella” brings to life the timeless images from Disney’s 1950 animated masterpiece as fully realized characters in a visually dazzling spectacle for a whole new generation.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
