Then, Pato and Pocoyó learn what it means to BOO! and be BOOED! Pocoyó has a new game which he enjoys playing on his friends: BOO!  Only some of his friends find Pocoyó’s game annoying or frightening. But this only encourages Pocoyó more. He boos poor Pato til he ends up a nervous wreck.  Elly sees how scared Pato has become and decides to give Pocoyó a taste of his own medicine. Elly makes Pocoyó jump.  At first Pocoyó doesn’t like it but ultimately Pato and Pocoyó both realises it can be fun to BOO! and to be BOOED! Then, loving your friends for who they are, and not what they look like is taught when during a windy day when Pato’s hat gets blown away. Pato doesn’t like the way he looks without his hat and he’s afraid his friends will laugh at him so he hides and won’t play. Finally they catch up with him and he tries on a selection of replacement hats, none of which quite fit the bill. When Elly and Pocoyó realise what’s wrong they don’t understand Pato’s reaction. They like the way he looks. Pato comes to see that his friends love him for who he is, not what he looks like and the friends all play happily together. In the end, Sleepy Bird has to pop out for a while and needs someone to look after little Baby Bird. Pato volunteers because he thinks that’s going to be a much easier job than tidying up the mess he’s made with Pocoyó. Baby Bird, and his chum Caterpillar, run rings round Pato who eventually appeals to Pocoyó for help. Pocoyó thinks he can take care of the situation easily himself, but he similarly is foxed by the little tykes. Finally Pocoyó and Pato work out that in order to get the little ones to do what they want, they are going to need to collaborate. By the time Sleepy Bird returns, Baby Bird and Caterpillar are fast asleep. Little does Sleepy Bird know the chaos that got them to that point!"},

"longDescription":"Pocoyó is scared when a stranger appears in Pocoyóland, but he soon comes to realise that he needn’t be scared of this little alien – and they become friends. Finally the alien goes home to his planet in outer space, but promises to be sure to come back and visit again soon. Later, Pocoyó and Pato are out for an adventure in the Vamoosh but have to land on a strange planet when a part of the Vamoosh falls off. Whilst searching for the missing part, Pato gets scared because he hears a strange, scary noise. He sees that it’s an alien which is making the noise, but Pocoyó doesn’t believe him.  Pocoyó soon sees for himself that Pato was telling the truth.  When the alien returns the piece of the Vamoosh that they were looking for they both realise there is nothing to be scared of and the alien just wants to make friends.  After that, Pocoyó and Elly have organised a picnic and they leave Pato in charge of guarding the sandwiches whilst they get everything ready. Incredibly the sandwiches suddenly start moving around. Pato can’t believe his eyes. When Pocoyó and Elly return they are angry with Pato. They think he took the sandwiches himself. They give one more chance, leaving him in charge of guarding the cake. Once again, amazingly, the cake runs away apparently on its own. Pato is once again berated by Pocoyó and Elly. Until they see what’s going on with their own eyes. Pocoyó investigates further. And discovers who it is that’s moving the food around: ANTS! Having worked out what’s going on, the friends invite the ants along to the picnic and they all have fun together. At the end, Pato finds an egg and immediately falls in love with it: he wants to take care of the little baby inside the egg. When the egg hatches he gets the shock of his life: it’s not a cute little duckling at all, but a very odd looking spider. His friends are terrified of the little creature and won’t play with Pato if he brings it along. Pato rather craftily and meanly makes the little spider go away and do things on its own, so Pato can play with Pocoyó and Elly. Finally the little spider makes their hearts melt when he shows them that there’s nothing to be scared of and he just wants to be their friend."},

Rocky tells Flynn that Sir Topham Hatt’s shed is on fire. Flynn goes on the tracks, even though the road is faster, because he doesn’t want to be a “big red wobble on wheels.” On the way to the shed, Flynn meets Butch and Bertie. They both need his help but Flynn chuffs on because he feels too silly to roll on the road. Flynn is late because he should have used the road! The crowd around the shed cheers for Flynn as he puts out the fire.He returns to help Butch and Bertie. Flynn isn’t a “big red wobble on wheels”! He’s the hero of the day! One day, Gordon is too snooty to notice some freight cars in front of him and crashes into them. Gordon’s buffer crashes onto the track and he loses his buffer. Den and Dart offer to help repair Gordon, but he insists that Diesels cannot fix Steamies, and he huffs away without his buffer.Mavis and Salty tell Gordon that he needs a buffer. Reluctantly, Gordon chuffs back to Den and Dart and they fix him with a yellow and black diesel buffer. Gordon is very embarrassed by it. Thomas makes Gordon realize that he should be happy that he is fixed and can be a Really Useful Engine! Gordon says sorry and thank you to Den and Dart because they are all – Diesels or Steamies – Really Useful Engines!"},

"longDescription":"As the title says, a fun group of songs are sung by Madeline and her friends. \"At the Hotel Riche\" - The girls visit the Hotel Riche and they run around having fun. \"We Can Make Our Own Fun\" - The girls sing a song about having fun and encourages kids to use their imaginations. \"The Play's the Thing\" - The girls put on a show and everyone fights over the lead roles, until Madeline points out that without the supporting cast, there could be no performance. \"Do the Job Together\" - The girls realize the importance of working together towards a goal. \"One Size Fits All\" - Madeline is feeling sad about being so short, but Miss Clavel sings a song about how everyone is different, and that small, medium, or large, size doesn't matter. \"Nobody's Better than Me\" - The girls are jealous of one of their classmates who gets to be painted by a famous artist and is acting very bigheaded, so they put paint on her hairbrush, and become even more exasperated when it turns out that the artist loves the new look! They fume until Miss Clavel sings a song about ignoring those who say they are better than you. \"One Little Lie Leads to Another\" - The girls learn the danger of telling little white lies, as they can quickly snowball into big lies, and telling the truth becomes very hard. \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" - The classic fable, Madeline-style. \"We'll Always Be There for You\" - Madeline is feeling down, but her friends convince her that they will always be there to cheer her up.   \"Company Company\" - One of the girls throws a big birthday bash, but everything goes wrong. It turns out that all you need to have a party is a few good friends. This is a  highly enjoyable collection of songs that kids will want to listen to over and over!"},
