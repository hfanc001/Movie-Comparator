"description":"Distinguished British man of letters J. R. Ackerley hardly thought himself a dog lover when, well into middle age, he came into possession of a German shepherd named Tulip. To his surprise, she turned out to be the love of his life, the \"ideal friend\" he had been seeking in vain for years. <i>My Dog Tulip<\/i>&#xa0;is a bittersweet retrospective account of their 16-year companionship, as well as a profound and subtle meditation on the strangeness that lies at the heart of all relationships. In vivid and sometimes startling detail, Ackerley tells of Tulip's often erratic behavior and very canine tastes and of his own fumbling but determined efforts to ensure for her an existence of perfect happiness.<br /><br />My Dog Tulip&#xa0;has been adapted to screen&#xa0;as a major animated&#xa0;feature film&#xa0;with a cast that includes&#xa0;Christopher Plummer,&#xa0;Lynn Redgrave, and Isabella Rossellini. It has been heralded as \"a stroke of genius\" by <i>New York Magazine<\/i> and \"the love story of the year\" by <i>Vanity Fair<\/i>."}]
