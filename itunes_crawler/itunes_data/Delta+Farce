"longDescription":"\"Delta Force\" is based upon the June, 1985 hijacking of a TWA jet, where passengers were held at gun-point by Iran-sympathetic Lebanese terrorists in Beirut. The film re-enacts various real life incidents from the crisis — an American serviceman is beaten to death, a terrorist holds a gun to the pilot's head as the pilot is being questioned by reporters — while depicting the tension aboard the plane and the agony of the passengers, held under the threat of death by the terrorists. The Delta Force, a crack anti-terrorist commando group, is preparing to rescue the passengers. Colonel Nick Alexander (Lee Marvin) is the grizzled commander of the task force; his best soldier is Major Scott McCoy (Chuck Norris), who was planning to retire but is called back into action for one last heroic stand against terrorism."},

"description":"Delta Force—the US Army’s most elite top-secret strike force. They dominate the modern battlefield, but you won’t hear about their heroics on CNN. No headlines can reveal their top-secret missions, and no book has ever taken readers inside—until now. Here, a founding member of Delta Force takes us behind the veil of secrecy and into the action to reveal the never-before-told story of First Special Forces Operational Detachment-D (Delta Force). <br /><br />He is a master of espionage, trained to take on hijackers, terrorists, and enemy armies. He can deploy by parachute or arrive by commercial aircraft, survive alone in hostile cities, speak foreign languages fluently, strike at enemy targets with stunning swiftness and extraordinary teamwork. He is the ultimate modern warrior: the Delta Force operator. <br /><br />In this dramatic chronicle, Eric Haney, one of the founding members of Delta Force, takes us inside this legendary counterterrorist unit. Here, for the first time, are details of the grueling selection process—designed to break the strongest of men—that singles out the best of the best. <br /><br />With heart-stopping immediacy, Haney tells what it’s really like to enter a hostage-held airplane. From his days in Beirut, he tells a remarkable tale of bodyguards and bombs, of a day-to-day life of madness and beauty, and of how he and a teammate are called on to kill two gunmen targeting US Marines at an airport. As part of the team sent to rescue American hostages in Tehran, Haney offers a first-person description of that failed mission that is a chilling, compelling account of a bold maneuver undone by chance—and a few fatal mistakes. <br /><br />From fighting guerrilla warfare in Honduras to rescuing missionaries in Sudan and leading the way onto the island of Grenada, Haney captures the daring and discipline that distinguish the men of Delta Force. <i>Inside Delta Force<\/i> brings honor to these singular men while it puts us in the middle of around-the-world action that is sudden, frightening, and nonstop."},

"description":"From former Delta Force commander and <i>New York Times<\/i> bestselling author of <i>Kill Bin Laden<\/i> comes the first novel in an explosive new series <br /><br />After September 11, 2001, Delta Force troop commander Dalton Fury was given the secret mission to hunt down and kill the most wanted man in the world, the details of which were recounted in his extraordinary <i>New York Times<\/i> best-seller <i>Kill Bin Laden<\/i>. Now, Fury draws upon his hard-won combat experience - and his gift for true-to-life storytelling - to offer a brand-new series of thrillers that are as close to reality as readers can get. <br /><br />Meet Kolt Raynor. A Delta Force operator and one-time American hero, he is still trying to make sense of his life - and duty - after a secret mission gone bad. Three years ago, in the mountains of Pakistan, Raynor made a split-second decision to disobey orders - one that got some of his teammates killed and the rest captured. Now he’s been given a second chance to do right by his country, his men, and himself. But Raynor’s shot at redemption comes at a price. <br /><br />A shadowy group of former colleagues has asked Raynor to return, alone, to Pakistan’s badlands. His assignment seems clear: find his missing men and bring them home. What Raynor never expected was to uncover a sinister al Qaeda plot to capture a Black Site - a secret U.S.­­ prison - and destabilize the region. Meanwhile, a ruthless, unknown enemy is on his trail… and he will stop at nothing to make sure that Raynor’s mission is not accomplished. An intense, gritty work of edge-of-your-seat suspense, <i>Black Site<\/i> is the first of what promises to be one of the most exciting fiction series of the new millennium."},

But Kolt is on the verge of getting forced out of JSOC for disobeying orders in Pakistan - and when he's offered a slot in Tungsten, an ultra-secret deep-cover organization, he jumps at the chance.

"description":"Still recovering from his near-fatal wounds suffered at the Yellow Creek Nuclear Plant, Delta Force Commander Major Kolt \"Racer\" Raynor is thrust into a new battle with some of the toughest killers he's ever faced - US Navy SEALs. Government austerity measures have the Joint Chiefs of Staff contemplating the unthinkable - combining Delta Force and the SEALs into a single unit or eliminating one entirely. Kolt's career is in jeopardy, and, worst of all, the final say rests in the hands of men who have reasons to want to see Kolt gone. <br /><br />Recovered from her own wounds, Cindy \"Hawk\" Bird is closing in on becoming the first official female operator in the history of the US military...she only has to survive an insertion into the most repressive regime on Earth. Meanwhile, a new terrorist threat looms on the horizon in the form of not one but possibly two mushroom clouds. Kolt earns his call sign as the action has him racing to the world's hottest combat zones from Syria to Ukraine on hunter-killer missions to eliminate the terrorists before they can enact their deadly mission. <br /><br />Half a world away, a spy deep in the secretive North Korean regime sends a desperate call for help. A new danger to world peace and security is growing in the heart of the increasingly unstable Communist country, and no amount of sanctions or political negotiations are going to stop it. Violently applied force is needed - and needed now before it's too late."},

"description":"The world knows her only as Eve... <br /><br />Though her songs have sold millions, she is an enigma, a bewitching mystery. But to former Delta Force operator Harry Bolt, she is an angel whose sultry, smoky voice brought him back to life after the nightmare of Afghanistan. Nothing else matters. And now a scared, helpless beauty has walked through the door of his San Diego private security firm, running from something secret, something deadly...and Harry knows immediately that this is the woman who saved him. He is the last hope for this intoxicating siren without a past. But though she burns to lose herself in Harry's powerful arms, Eve is wary of trusting this tough, haunted ex-soldier who promises to protect her. Surrender could mean sweet ecstasy or certain doom. Can she open her heart, even if it means risking her life?"},

"description":"Video game coder Harley Kelso thought a tandem skydive would help her make her latest game more realistic. Instead, it literally put her in the arms of the sexiest man she's ever seen. Geeky to the core, Harley is the polar opposite of big and burly Beckett, but that doesn't stop her from wanting to play more carnal games with the sexy soldier. <br /><br />When Beckett \"Coach\" Ralston offers to fill-in at a friend's skydiving club, he doesn't suspect he'll meet a woman who will change his life - and he definitely doesn't expect her to save it. But that's exactly what happens when an accident mid-air forces Harley to land them both safely. She's earned Coach's complete gratitude, and even more, sexual interest. <br /><br />Until she disappears without a trace. <br /><br />With Harley missing, a happy ending might not be in the cards for the man who loves her - especially when he becomes the main suspect."},

"description":"As a flight attendant, Rayne Jackson is used to cancellations, but she never dreamed her latest would lead to a whirlwind tour of London with a handsome stranger...or a life-altering night in his bed. One evening is all the enigmatic man can give her, and Rayne greedily takes it, despite suspecting it will never be enough. <br /><br />Heading home after another extreme mission, Keane \"Ghost\" Bryson hadn't planned to seduce someone during his layover, but Rayne is too sweet to resist. Being a Delta Force member means lying to protect his identity, which is unfortunate, considering Rayne seems made for Ghost, right down to the tattoo on her back. For the first time in his life, regret fills him as he slips away the following morning. <br /><br />Both are shocked when, months later, they meet again - under the worst possible circumstances. Seems fate has given them a second chance...if they can survive the terrorist situation they're in. If Rayne can forgive Ghost his lies. And if Ghost can trust Rayne to be strong enough to endure the secrets and uncertainty that come with loving a Delta Force soldier."},

"description":"Renting out the apartment over his garage shouldn't be a life-changing decision, but when Delta soldier Cormac \"Fletch\" Fletcher meets Emily Grant, he feels an instant connection. He can't stand the thought of Emily and her young daughter living anywhere unsafe. Offering cheap rent is a small price to pay for their safety...and Fletch's peace of mind. <br /><br />Being a single mother is difficult at best, but renting the extremely affordable space from Fletch makes Emily's life a lot easier...until it doesn't. Suddenly all the money she's saving thanks to Fletch's generosity is going into the hands of a blackmailer. And what little food Emily can afford goes to her daughter Annie, so the girl doesn't go to bed hungry...leaving Emily weaker and weaker. <br /><br />When miscommunication has Emily assuming Fletch is in on the blackmail, he not only has to gain her trust, but also deal with a man holding a grudge against Fletch and his entire Delta Force team. A task made more difficult when the dangerous man gets his hands on Emily and Annie. <br /><br /><i>Rescuing Emily<\/i> is the second book in the Delta Force Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings."},
