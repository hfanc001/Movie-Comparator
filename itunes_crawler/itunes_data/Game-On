She attacks him right back about spending, the girls’ school and her bad back—she’s no drug addict. Akalitus announces that nearby hospitals have closed down and that the staff should remain on their toes. A hungover Sam is now totally beholden to Jackie and Thor for their help. Post intervention, things are tense with O’Hara and Jackie, and O’Hara goes to Akalitus, hoping to avoid working with Jackie. Coop avoids Sam and treats a little boy who stuck a small mirror up his nose, trying to see his brain. Zoey confesses to everyone that she and Lenny had sex. Kevin enrolls Fiona in Immaculate Virgin and shows up unannounced at the ER, causing a stir and freaking out Eddie and Jackie. After her shift, Jackie shows up at the softball field to cheer Kevin and his bar team on. Things are strained, but she’s not showing it."},

Mikey has charged herself with producing the best Fashion Weekend LA has ever seen. After finding the perfect location for her client, she races off to receive an award from the Chamber of Commerce.  She can’t wait to share her big night with Raquel, but she's nowhere to be found and devastating news about the venue further riles Mikey.  Whitney is overwhelmed, both with Tor moving in and her complicated feelings for Sara. At a bar, she again runs into recent hookup, Romi – and this time their exchange ends in a kiss! Will Whitney be able to juggle all of these relationships?  Nikki and Jill are hoping to turn a book about 'sexual fluidity' into a documentary, a topic close to Jill.  It comes into greater focus when her best friend Derek pays a visit and it’s revealed how close the two came to dating.  Rose and Natalie celebrate their seven-month anniversary with a romantic dinner followed by a steamy nightcap at home. Later, Rose’s father encourages Rose to reconcile with her estranged mother – their feud is tearing the family apart. With pressure from Natalie and her family mounting, Rose cuts loose at a debaucherous game night with friends but it quickly turns into a major blowout."},
