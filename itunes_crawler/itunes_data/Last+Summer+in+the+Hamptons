"longDescription":"Filmed entirely on location in East Hampton, Long Island, \"LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS\" concerns a large theatrical family spending the last weekend of their summer together at their decades-old family retreat, while economic circumstances have forced them to put the home on the market. Victoria Foyt (OONA HART) plays a young Hollywood actress whose visit wreaks havoc on this stellar group of family and friends, including an extraordinary mix of prominent New York actors, directors and playwrights led by matriarch Viveca Lindfors (HELENA MORA). In the course of a very unusual weekend, comic as well as serious situations arise, and the family’s secrets – of which there are many – begin to unravel."},
