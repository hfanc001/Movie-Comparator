But his peaceful existence is shattered when three hit men show up in his house, and Frank must call on every ounce of his past training to escape with his life. Knowing that whoever’s trying to kill him will likely target those he cares for, Frank snatches Sarah from her home and flees, struggling to stay one step ahead of his deadly pursuers. But when Frank and Sarah begin digging into the identity of his attackers, they discover Frank is on a hit list along with several of his former CIA cohorts—and that the organization ordering the killings is none other than the Agency itself. Someone at the CIA wants him dead. But who? And why? Going on the offensive, Frank rounds up an unlikely crew of his past agency sidekicks, including the paranoid Marvin, the loyal Joe and the lovely Victoria. With the Agency hot on their trails, Frank and his team must do everything they can to solve the mystery before it’s too late—and hopefully instil in their assailants some of the old-school code of honor by which they still choose to live.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"Academy Award® Winner Nicolas Cage (National Treasure: Book of Secrets, Leaving Las Vegas) stars in KNOWING, a gripping action-thriller of global proportions about a professor who stumbles on terrifying predictions about the future—and sets out to prevent them from coming true. In 1958, as part of the dedication ceremony for a new elementary school, a group of students is asked to draw pictures to be stored in a time capsule. But one mysterious girl fills her sheet of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead. Fifty years later, a new generation of students examines the capsule's contents and the girl's cryptic message ends up in the hands of young CALEB KOESTLER. But it is Caleb's father, professor JOHN KOESTLER (Nicolas Cage), who makes the startling discovery that the encoded message predicts with pinpoint accuracy the dates, death tolls and coordinates of every major disaster of the past 50 years. As John further unravels the document's chilling secrets, he realizes the document foretells three additional events—the last of which hints at destruction on a global scale and seems to somehow involve John and his son. When John's attempts to alert the authorities fall on deaf ears, he takes it upon himself to try to prevent more destruction from taking place. With the reluctant help of DIANA WAYLAND (Rose Byrne) and ABBY WAYLAND, the daughter and granddaughter of the now-deceased author of the prophecies, John's increasingly desperate efforts take him on a heart-pounding race against time until he finds himself facing the ultimate disaster—and the ultimate sacrifice.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
