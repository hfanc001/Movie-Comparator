"longDescription":"Sydney Pollack's first feature-length documentary focuses on acclaimed architect Frank O. Gehry. Beginning with the architect's own original sketches for each major project, the film explores Gehry's process of turning these abstract drawings first into three-dimensional models, often made simply of cardboard and tape, then into finished buildings of titanium and glass, concrete and steel, wood and stone. While the intimate dialogue between the two old friends courses like a continuous melodic line through the film, Pollack captures the grandeur of Gehry's architecture-from his earliest building, a hay barn, to what are now recognized as some of the great buildings of the modern era, including the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles."}]
