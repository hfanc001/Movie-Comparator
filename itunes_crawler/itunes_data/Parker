"longDescription":"Parker (Jason Statham) is a professional thief who lives by a personal code of ethics: Don't steal from people who can't afford it and don't hurt people who don't deserve it.  But on his latest heist, his crew double crosses him, steals his stash, and leaves him for dead. Determined to make sure they regret it, Parker tracks them to Palm Beach, playground of the rich and famous, where the crew is planning their biggest heist ever. Donning the disguise of a rich Texan, Parker takes on an unlikely partner, Leslie (Jennifer Lopez), a savvy insider, who's short on cash, but big on looks, smarts and ambition. Together, they devise a plan to hijack the score, take everyone down and get away clean. Also starring Michael Chiklis.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"Retired agent Frank Moses leads a quiet—some might say boring—life, gardening and finding excuses to chat on the phone with Sarah, a 30-something federal pension worker. But his peaceful existence is shattered when three hit men show up in his house, and Frank must call on every ounce of his past training to escape with his life. Knowing that whoever’s trying to kill him will likely target those he cares for, Frank snatches Sarah from her home and flees, struggling to stay one step ahead of his deadly pursuers. But when Frank and Sarah begin digging into the identity of his attackers, they discover Frank is on a hit list along with several of his former CIA cohorts—and that the organization ordering the killings is none other than the Agency itself. Someone at the CIA wants him dead. But who? And why? Going on the offensive, Frank rounds up an unlikely crew of his past agency sidekicks, including the paranoid Marvin, the loyal Joe and the lovely Victoria. With the Agency hot on their trails, Frank and his team must do everything they can to solve the mystery before it’s too late—and hopefully instil in their assailants some of the old-school code of honor by which they still choose to live.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

After years of abuse at the wicked trio's hands, Mary, now a junior at ritzy Beverly Hills High School, is counting down the days until her dance audition for the prestigious Manhattan Academy of Performing Arts, where she hopes to transfer for a bright future away from Dominique and her over-demanding brood. When teen pop sensation Joey Parker returns to Beverly Hills High to finish up school like a \"normal\" teen, the stage is set for a masquerade dance, mistaken identity, and a search for the girl who dropped her iPod (the modern equivalent of a glass slipper) while fleeing from the dance. This modern fairy tale proves you don't need a fairy godmother to make magic happen, or to have a happy ending!"},

After leading his team to fifteen winning seasons, football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is demoted and replaced by Herman Boone (Washington), tough, opinionated and as different from the beloved Yoast as he could be. How these two men overcome their differences, and turn a group of hostile young men into champions, plays out in a remarkable and triumphant story full of soul and spirit.
