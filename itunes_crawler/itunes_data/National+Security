"description":"When terrorism goes viral, one man goes ballistic.<br /><br />They can strike anytime, anywhere. A public landmark. A suburban shopping mall. And now, the human body itself. Three Middle Eastern terrorists have been injected with a biological weapon, human time bombs unleashed on American soil. They are prepared to die. To spread their disease. To annihilate millions. If America hopes to fight this enemy from within, it needs a new kind of weapon. Meet Special Agent Jericho Quinn. Air force veteran. Champion boxer. Trained assassin. Handpicked for a new global task force that, officially, does not exist, Quinn answers only to the director of National Intelligence and the US president himself.<br /><br />His methods are as simple—and brutal—as his codename: the Hammer.<br /><br />MARC CAMERON, a native of Texas, has spent over twentyfive years in law enforcement, the last twenty with the federal government. His assignments have taken him from rural Alaska to Manhattan, Canada to Mexico, and points in between. Having earned a second degree black belt in jujitsu, he often teaches defensive tactics to other law enforcement agencies and civilian groups. He currently lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife and BMW motorcycle."},

"longDescription":"War on Whistleblowers: Free Press and the National Security State highlights four cases where whistleblowers noticed government wrong-doing and took to the media to expose the fraud and abuse. It exposes the surprisingly worsening and threatening reality for whistleblowers and the press. The film includes interviews with whistleblowers Michael DeKort, Thomas Drake, Franz Gayl and Thomas Tamm and award-winning journalists like David Carr, Lucy Dalglish, Glenn Greenwald, Seymour Hersh, Michael Isikoff, Bill Keller, Eric Lipton, Jane Mayer, Dana Priest, Tom Vanden Brook and Sharon Weinberger. With President Obama's commitment to transparency and the passage of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, there was hope that whistleblowers would finally have more protection and encouragement to speak up. But times have never been worse for national security whistleblowers. New rights are all about employment and do nothing to protect against threats of prosecution and incarceration. In fact, the Obama administration has attacked more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than all previous administrations combined. There are 56 federal laws about whistleblower job rights, but none about protection from imprisonment."},

"description":"Fearless counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp finds himself directly in the line of fire in the latest riveting political thriller from <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Vince Flynn.<br />For years, Mitch Rapp's bold actions have saved the lives of countless Americans. His battles for peace and freedom have made him a hero to many, and an enemy to countless more. In the tangled, duplicitous world of espionage, there are those, even among America's allies, who want to see Mitch Rapp eliminated. They have decided the time has come.<br /><br />Now, the powerful father of a dead terrorist demands vengeance in its simplest form, an eye for an eye, and Rapp instantly becomes the target of an international conspiracy. This time, he must use all of his vigilance and determination to save himself before he can turn his fury on those who have dared to betray him.<br /><br /><i>Consent to Kill<\/i> takes listeners behind the headlines and catapults them to the front lines of the global war on terror. It sizzles \"with inside information, military muscle, and CIA secrets\" (Dan Brown). Vince Flynn mixes military technology with his exclusive knowledge of Washington politics to create a hero that Americans will wish existed outside the realm of fiction."},

What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage, not by guns or bombs, but by a code so complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence. Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in.

"description":"Colin Powell is the embodiment of the American dream. He was born in Harlem to immigrant parents from Jamaica. He knew the rough life of the streets. He overcame a barely average start at school. Then he joined the Army. The rest is history - including Vietnam, the Pentagon, Panama, and Desert Storm - but a history that until now has been known only on the surface. Here, for the first time, Colin Powell himself tells us how it happened, in a memoir distinguished by a heartfelt love of country and family, warm good humor, and a soldier's directness.<br /><i>My American Journey<\/i> is the powerful story of a life well lived and well told. It is also a view from the mountaintop of the political landscape of America. At a time when Americans feel disenchanted with their leaders, General Powell's passionate views on family, personal responsibility, and, in his own words, \"the greatness of America and the opportunities it offers\" inspire hope and present a blueprint for the future. An utterly absorbing account, it is history with a vision."},

"description":"Richard Clarke's statement to the 9-11 families that \"Your government failed you - and I failed you\" was the most dramatic moment in the 9-11 Commission hearings. His number-one best seller, <i>Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror<\/i>, explained how the U.S. had stumbled into a struggle with violent Islamist extremists.<br />Now, in <i>Your Government Failed You<\/i>, Clarke looks at why failures have continued and how America and the world can succeed against the terrorists.<br /><br />But Clarke goes beyond terrorism to examine the recurring U.S. government disasters. Despite the lessons of Vietnam, we've gotten involved in Iraq. A trail of intelligence failures litter the Washington landscape. From Katrina to color codes and duct tape, homeland security has been an oxymoron.

"description":"Richard A. Clarke warned America once before about the havoc terrorism would wreak on our national security-and he was right. Now he warns us of another threat, silent but equally dangerous. Cyber War is a powerful book about technology, government, and military strategy; about criminals, spies, soldiers, and hackers. <br /><br />This is the first book about the war of the future - cyber war - and a convincing argument that we may already be in peril of losing it.Cyber War goes behind the \"geek talk\" of hackers and computer scientists to explain clearly and convincingly what cyber war is, how cyber weapons work, and how vulnerable we are as a nation and as individuals to the vast and looming web of cyber criminals. From the first cyber crisis meeting in the White House a decade ago to the boardrooms of Silicon Valley and the electrical tunnels under Manhattan, Clarke and coauthor Robert K. Knake trace the rise of the cyber age and profile the unlikely characters and places at the epicenter of the battlefield. They recount the foreign cyber spies who hacked into the office of the Secretary of Defense, the control systems for U.S. electric power grids, and the plans to protect America's latest fighter aircraft. <br /><br />Economically and militarily, Clarke and Knake argue, what we've already lost in the new millennium's cyber battles is tantamount to the Soviet and Chinese theft of our nuclear bomb secrets in the 1940s and 1950s. The possibilities of what we stand to lose in an all-out cyber war-our individual and national security among them-are just as chilling. Powerful and convincing, <i>Cyber War<\/i> begins the critical debate about the next great threat to national security."},

"description":"On Parrish Island, a restricted island off the coast of Virginia, is a little-known and never-visited psychiatric facility. There, far from prying eyes, the government stores former intelligence employees whose psychiatric states make them a danger to their own government, people whose ramblings might endanger ongoing operations or prove dangerously inconvenient. One of these employees, former Consular Operations agent Hal Ambler, is kept heavily medicated and closely watched. But there's one difference between Hal and the other patients, Hal isn't crazy. With the help of a sympathetic nurse, Hal manages to clear his mind of the drug-induced haze and then pulls off a daring escape. Now he's out to discover who stashed him here and why, but the world he returns to isn't the one he remembers. Friends and longtime associates don't remember him, there are no official records of Hal Ambler, and, when he first sees himself in the mirror, the face that looks back at him is not the one he knows as his own."},

"description":"A former top-level National Security Agency insider goes behind the headlines to explore America's next great battleground: digital security. An urgent wake-up call that identifies our foes; unveils their methods; and charts the dire consequences for government, business, and individuals. Shortly after 9/11, Joel Brenner entered the inner sanctum of American espionage, first as the inspector general of the National Security Agency, then as the head of counterintelligence for the director of national intelligence. He saw at close range the battleground on which our adversaries are now attacking us-cyberspace. <br /><br />We are at the mercy of a new generation of spies who operate remotely from China, the Middle East, Russia, even France, among many other places. These operatives have already shown their ability to penetrate our power plants, steal our latest submarine technology, rob our banks, and invade the Pentagon's secret communications systems. <br /><br />Incidents like the WikiLeaks posting of secret U.S. State Department cables hint at the urgency of this problem, but they hardly reveal its extent or its danger. Our government and corporations are a \"glass house,\" all but transparent to our adversaries. Counterfeit computer chips have found their way into our fighter aircraft; the Chinese stole a new radar system that the navy spent billions to develop; our own soldiers used intentionally corrupted thumb drives to download classified intel from laptops in Iraq. And much more. <br /><br />Dispatches from the corporate world are just as dire. In 2008, hackers lifted customer files from the Royal Bank of Scotland and used them to withdraw $9 million in half an hour from ATMs in the United States, Britain, and Canada. If that was a traditional heist, it would be counted as one of the largest in history. Worldwide, corporations lose on average $5 million worth of intellectual property apiece annually, and big companies lose many times that."},

"description":"Here is the ultimate insider's account from the highest and most sensitive levels of the Clinton administration, revealing how the irresponsible use of power can lead to a terrible price paid by all Americans. <br /><br />Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Robert \"Buzz\" Patterson was one of the military aides to commander-in-chief William Jefferson Clinton. What Patterson saw shocked him - and finally led him to write this stunning book. It is a warning of just what harm an irresponsible president can do to our national security - harm that, Patterson shows, made the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, almost inevitable."}]
