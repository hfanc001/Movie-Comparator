"longDescription":"During his lifetime, J. Edgar Hoover would rise to be the most powerful man in America. As head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for nearly 50 years, he would stop at nothing to protect his country. Through eight presidents and three wars, Hoover waged battle against threats both real and perceived, often bending the rules to keep his countrymen safe. His methods were at once ruthless and heroic, with the admiration of the world his most coveted, if ever elusive, prize. Hoover was a man who placed great value on secrets-particularly those of others-and was not afraid to use that information to exert authority over the leading figures in the nation. Understanding that knowledge is power and fear poses opportunity, he used both to gain unprecedented influence and to build a reputation that was both formidable and untouchable."},

Edgar Hoover, consolidated his power through a combination of brilliant Public Relations moves and compromising personal files he kept on politicians. Hoover was also often at odds with left-leaning Black leaders throughout his reign, including Marcus Garvey and Paul Robeson. He undertook a virtual counter-revolution against the civil rights movement, enabling the Bureau to employ blackmail, smear campaigns, “dirty tricks,” and even armed attacks on several leaders. The most notorious bureau program, Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), was implicated in the framing and even murder of several prominent activists."},

What he became was the symbol of the most unpopular war in U.S. history.

Based on public documents and extensive interviews, the film stars Michael Gambon as the former president who allowed himself to be persuaded by his advisors to increase the U.S. military presence in Vietnam at the expense of his vision of a Great Society. Co-starring Donald Sutherland, Bruce McGill, James Frain, Felicity Huffman and Alec Baldwin. Directed by John Frankenheimer; written by Daniel Giat."},

"longDescription":"Not a moment too soon, \"The Atomic Cafe\" is back to provide us with a much-needed release of comic energy. A dark comedy in the truest sense, this timeless classic took the nation by storm when it first debuted in 1982. The film recounts a defining period of 20th century history and serves as a chilling and often hilarious reminder of cold-war era paranoia in the United States--artfully presented through a collage of newsreel footage, government archives, military training films, and fifties music. Profoundly shocking and perversely topical, \"The Atomic Cafe\" craftily captures a panicked nation, offering a fascinating and witty account of life during the atomic age and resulting cold war, when fall-out shelters, duck-and-cover drills, and government propaganda were all a part of our social consciousness. Regarded by critics as 'a nuclear Reefer Madness' and likened to Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, this profoundly shocking and highly amusing film is a stunner, a gripping account of an unforgettable era and an indisputable 'must-see' for all Americans."},

"description":"In <i>Public Enemies<\/i>, Bryan Burrough strips away a thick layer of myths put out by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI to tell the full story of the most spectacular crime wave in American history, the two-year battle between the young Hoover and an assortment of criminals who became national icons: John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barkers.<br /> In 1933, police jurisdictions ended at state lines, the FBI was in its infancy, and fast cars and machine guns were easily available. It was a great time to be a bank robber. On hand were a motley crew of criminal masterminds, sociopaths, romantics, and cretins.<br /><br /> Bryan Burrough has unearthed an extraordinary amount of new material on all the major figures involved, revealing many fascinating interconnections in the vast underworld ecosystem that stretched from Texas up to Minnesota.<br /><br /> But the real-life connections were insignificant next to the sense of connectedness J. Edgar Hoover worked to create in the mind of the American public, using the \"Great Crime Wave\" to gain the position of untouchable power he would occupy for almost half a century."},

"description":"Here is the true story of how a small-town lawman in upstate New York busted a Cosa Nostra conference in 1957, exposing the Mafia to America. <br /><br />In a small village in upstate New York, mob bosses from all over the country—including Vito Genovese, Carlo Gambino, Joe Bonanno, Joe Profaci, Cuba boss Santo Trafficante, Jr., and future Gambino boss Paul Castellano—were nabbed by Sergeant Edgar D. Croswell as they gathered to sort out a bloody war of succession. <br /><br />For years FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had adamantly denied the existence of the Mafia, but young Robert Kennedy immediately recognized the shattering importance of the Apalachin summit. Appointed attorney general after his brother John became president, Bobby embarked on a campaign to break the spine of the mob, engaging in a furious turf battle with the powerful Hoover. <br /><br />Detailing mob killings, the early days of the heroin trade, and the crusade to loosen the hold of organized crime, this momentous story will caputre fans of Gus Russo and Luc Sante. Reavill scintillatingly recounts the beginning of the end for the Mafia in America and how it all began with a good man in the right place at the right time. <br /><br />Gil Reavill is an author, screenwriter, and playwright whose work has been widely featured in magazines. He is the author of <i>Aftermath, Inc.<\/i> and coauthor of <i>Beyond All Reason<\/i> and the screenplay that became the 2006 film <i>Dirty,<\/i> starring Cuba Gooding, Jr."},

"description":"Science caught up with the psychic readings of Edgar Cayce when it proved that all of materiality—consisting of atoms and therefore protons, neutrons, and electrons—is energy in motion. Everything is a vibration, all of life releases vibrations, and even locations have their own vibrations. The Cayce readings suggest that vibrations are also associated with healing and consciousness and that all of life in every dimension is actually just different manifestations of the One Force—the Force that moved all of Creation into being. Vibrations are essentially spirit in motion, and our thoughts and actions affect our life and our fulfillment in how we are living it. Todeschi’s popular book is now available in audio format, read by voice-talent Arthur Ray."},

"description":"J. Edgar Hoover called the FBI the \"Seat of Government\", and in many way it was. He was one of the most powerful men in American history and while he was at the helm of the \"Seat of Government\", few dared to defy him. He was a law onto himself, the self-anointed protector of American security and virtues. Hoover's career with the FBI spanned 10 presidents, eight while he was the director. Trying to understand J. Edgar is like trying to solve a Rubic's cube with both hands tied behind the back. He was a master of organization, a world-class spinmeister, an astute manager who knew how to motivate, and how to scare the wits out of his subordinates - and often his superiors. Yet he built the most powerful, sophisticated, and least corruptible law enforcement institution on Earth. He was also vindictive, willing to use extrajudicial and unconstitutional methods to arrive at his objectives - the ends, for Hoover, unquestionably justified the means. Award-winning author Daniel Alef's biographical profile presents a three-dimensional view of Hoover, a fast and fascinating tale of an American icon."},

"longDescription":"Tonight on the program at the Hollywood Bowl: murder! A bravura production of Verdi's Il trovatore is the setting for this con brio blend of music, mystery and murder most foul. Leo Carrillo portrays Gino D'Acosta, a brilliant tenor who has millions of die-hard fans and at least one die-now enemy. Warned of impending doom by a mystic, Gino laughs it off – until he performs an aria, then perishes – the victim of poisoning – in front of 20,000 wildly applauding witnesses. Whodunit? An L.A. cop (Chester Morris) has a long cast of suspects: the mystic, a deranged composer, an ambitious understudy, the cuckolded opera conductor, Gino's cast-off mistress, Gino's latest sweetheart and the sweetheart's former beau (Duncan Renaldo, who would play Cisco to Carrillo's Pancho in The Cisco Kid TV series and several films).

"description":"This Annotated Omnibus Edition contains the first three novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian tales (the Barsoom series).<br /><br />The first of these novels, <i>A Princess of Mars<\/i>, was Burroughs' first book, and he wrote the next two novels in quick succession. Together they tell the story of John Carter of Mars - how he came to Mars, met the love of his life, and quickly found himself occupied full-time defending her and saving his adopted planet from interplanetary evildoers.<br /><br />This trilogy opened the doors of popular science fiction to an entire nation and world. It launched the original pulp science fiction storyworld and series, often imitated but never duplicated, and has inspired four generations of young sci-fi and fantasy writers, artists, moviemakers and videogame designers. <br /><br />And, of course, it's a ripping great story.<br /><br />This Pulp-Lit Press Annotated Omnibus Edition takes those three novels together as a coherent story. Each is gracefully and unobtrusively annotated, to help the modern reader put it in the proper literary and historical context for maximum reading enjoyment. All annotations are presented together in a single chapter, easily skipped by readers who prefer to get on with the story."},
