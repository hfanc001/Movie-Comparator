"description":"The dialogue expands.... <br /><br /><i>Conversations with God, Book 3<\/i> is the final book of the original three-book series. As was written in the introduction to Book 1, it deals with \"universal truths to the highest order, and the challenges and opportunities of the soul.\" In Book 3, the dialogue expands to include more about the nature of God, about love and fear, about who we are and who we may become, and about the evolution of the human species that is about to take its place in the universal neighborhood. <br /><br />Here is a profound dialogue about the culture, philosophy, and spirituality of highly evolved beings (some of whom we presently call \"aliens\" or \"ETs\") in other realms of the universe, and how they have learned to view life, love, and the pursuit of happiness. By reading this book, you will begin to see life in a different way and begin to question the truth of what you have known on this planet: <i>\"And so I end this dialogue as it began. As with life itself, it comes full circle. You have been given truth here. You have been given joy. You have been given love. You have been given here the answers to the largest mysteries of life. There is now only one question remaining. It is the question with which we began. The question is not, to whom do I talk, but who listens?\"<\/i>"},

"description":"Suppose you could ask God the most puzzling questions about existence, and God would provide clear, understandable answers? It happened to Neale Donald Walsch. <i>Conversations with God<\/i> is Walsch's account of his direct conversations with God, beginning in 1992 while Walsch was immersed in a period of deep depression. He composed a letter to God in which he vented his frustrations, and much to his surprise, even shock, God answered him. <br /><br />Focusing on the universal truths that influence all life, <i>Conversations with God<\/i> offers a picture of the way life could be better. The dialogue challenges us to push past the imagined boundaries of what we believe ourselves capable of and look instead to all that we can attain as cocreators with God. <br /><br />Neale Donald Walsch lives with his wife, Nancy, in southern Oregon. Together they have formed ReCreation, a nonprofit foundation for personal growth and spiritual understanding with the goal of giving people back to themselves. Walsch lectures and hosts workshops throughout the country to support and spread the messages contained in <i>Conversations with God.<\/i> <br /><br />Awardwinning actor Edward Asner is best known for the television series Lou Grant. Ellen Burstyn's film roles have established her as one of the greatest modern actresses."},

He presents a cross-section of those conversations in Toto Coelo: By the whole extent of the heavens. Not one word was changed, added, or deleted to conform to some personal or secular belief. <br /><br />Thought-provoking and fun, Toto Coelo inspires its listeners to laugh, scoff, and shed a tear or two.
