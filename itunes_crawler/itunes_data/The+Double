After holding up a restaurant for quick cash, the girls head to the shore in a stolen car for what they discover is the party of a lifetime. They’re thrown in jail — but quickly bailed out by Alien (James Franco), a local rapper, drug pusher and arms dealer who lures them into a criminal underbelly that’s as lurid as it is liberating for a close-knit gang of girlfriends who are still figuring out their path. With a hallucinatory musical score by Cliff Martinez (DRIVE) and Skrillex, SPRING BREAKERS is an electrifying pop poem to girls gone wild. Harmony Korine unleashes a ferocious, feverish and furiously alive youth quake examining the sensory overload of a new generation of restless youth.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
