"longDescription":"The Pink Panther meets Borat in this broad satire about a bumbling yet lovable Iranian immigrant who wins the Green Card lottery and moves to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming an American hero. Jimmy Vestvood (Maz Jobrani) aspires to be a cool cop like his childhood idol, Steve McQueen in the movie Bullitt, but soon discovers that the best job he can get is as a security guard at a Persian grocery store. Through a series of comically fateful events, Jimmy's naivet√© is exploited when a corrupt arms dealer (John Heard) hires him as a private investigator. Framed as a terrorist by the fear-mongering Kox News, Jimmy is unwittingly embroiled in a conspiracy to start the next world war. With the help of his seventh cousin Leila (Sheila Vand), Jimmy must save the day and avert the imminent war while keeping his overprotective mother in the dark."}]
