"longDescription":"After arranging to meet Samantha to celebrate their six month anniversary, Darrin arrives at his office to meet Margaret Marshall, chairman of the board of a cosmetics firm. Margaret, a stunning woman in her late thirties, successful both with men and in business, insists that Darrin fly to Chicago that night to complete the quarter million dollar campaign he had planned for her company. Fumbling out of the anniversary arrangements with Samantha, Darrin flies to Chicago and meets Margaret, who has become quite interested in him, aboard her yacht. There, Darrin sees a cat and feels it may be Samantha, egged on by her mother, Endora, to fly to Chicago to check on his activities. While Darrin evades Margaret's advances, a pelican arrives on the scene. Although both Margaret and Captain Kelly feel there is something strange in Darrin's reactions to the animals, Margaret, realizing Darrin is truly in love with his wife, ac-cepts his advertising campaign. Greeted by Samantha at home, Darrin is reassured that the cat he has brought with him is not his wife. However, when the pelican arrives, Darrin is uncertain whether it might not be Endora."},

Later, when it appears that Abner, using all his privileges as a guest, is more than satisfied with the arrangements and is making no effort to return to his own home, Darrin demands that Samantha take action. Not only is Samantha unsuccessful in all her attempts to effect a reconciliation, but she learns that Gladys wants a divorce.
