"longDescription":"Based on the best-selling playbook for gettin’ some, this uproarious, unrated release is so shockingly raunchy, it will leave you gasping (if not gagging) with laughter!  A connoisseur of fast times and faster women, Tucker Max (Czuchry) unleashes his wit and wants on every unsuspecting female around – from horny hotties to aroused cougars to one amorous dwarf – for one night of non-stop debauchery. But the night gets out of control when the boys meet a stripper who can match their misogynist mouths, and Tucker becomes the butt of a vengeful practical joke. Nothing is sacred in one of the smartest, most well-written, disgusting, hilarious, endearing, offensive and downright best comedies within its genre to date!"},

"description":"From the author:<br /> \"My name is Tucker Max, and I am an asshole. I get excessively drunk at inappropriate times, disregard social norms, indulge every whim, ignore the consequences of my actions, mock idiots and posers, sleep with more women than is safe or reasonable, and just generally act like a raging dickhead. But, I do contribute to humanity in one very important way: I share my adventures with the world.\"<br /><br /> Actual reader feedback:<br /><br /> \"I am completely baffled as to how you can congratulate yourself for being a womanizer and a raging drunk, or think anyone cares about an idiot like you. Do you really think that exploiting the insecurities of others while getting wasted is a legitimate thing to offer?\"<br /><br /> \"Thank you, thank you, thank you: for sharing with us your wonderful tales of drunken revelry, for teaching me what it means to be a man, for just existing so I know that there is another option; I too can say 'screw the system' and be myself and have fun. My life truly began when I finished reading your stories. Now, when faced with a quandary about what course of action I should take, I just ask myself, 'What would Tucker do?', and I do it, and I am a better man for it.\"<br /><br /> \"I find it truly appalling that there are people in the world like you. You are a disgusting, vile, repulsive, repugnant, foul creature. Because of you, I don't believe in God anymore. No just God would allow someone like you to exist.\"<br /><br /> \"I'll stay with God as my Lord, but you are my savior. I just finished reading your brilliant stories, and I laughed so hard I almost vomited. I want to bring that kind of joy to people. You're an artist of the highest order and a true humanitarian to boot. I'm in both shock and awe at how much I want to be you.\"<br /><br /> \"You are the coolest person I can even imagine existing. If you slept with my girlfriend, it'd make me love her more.\""},
