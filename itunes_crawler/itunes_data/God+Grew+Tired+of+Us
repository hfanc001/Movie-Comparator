"longDescription":"An award-winning, critically acclaimed documentary, narrated by Nicole Kidman, \"God Grew Tired of Us\" explores the indomitable spirit of three \"Lost Boys\" from the Sudan who are forced to leave their homeland due to a tumultuous civil war. Traveling barefoot across the sub-Saharan desert, John Bul Dau, Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Blor were among the 25,000 \"Lost Boys\" (ages 3 to 13) who fled villages, formed surrogate families and sought refuge from famine, disease, wild animals and attacks from rebel soldiers. Named by a journalist after Peter Pan's posse of orphans who protected and provided for each other, the \"Lost Boys\" traveled together for five years and against all odds crossed into the UN's refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. A journey's end for some, it was only the beginning for John, Daniel and Panther, who along with 3800 other young survivors, were selected to re-settle in the United States. The documentary chronicles their triumph over seemingly insurmountable adversities and a relocation to America, where the \"Lost Boys\" build active and fulfilling new lives but remain deeply committed to helping friends and family they have left behind. The film is produced by Brad Pitt and Dermot Mulroney."}]
