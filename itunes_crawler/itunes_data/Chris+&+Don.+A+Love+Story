She synchronized with gem performances by fellow Academy Award nominees Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver who created an emotional household unlike any other in film built upon this father's superstitious bookmaking on Philadelphia Eagles games.  With a stellar cast rounded out by Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Anupam Kehr, Shea Whigham, and Julia Stiles, the film was singled out by US Senators in Washington seeking parity for mental health treatment and services.
