Both underdogs, Harold and Kumar decide to spend what would have been an otherwise uneventful Friday night satisfying an oddly intense urge for White Castle hamburgers. However, finding a White Castle proves a highly difficult task, and the two friends wind up on an epic road trip of deep thoughts, deeper inhaling, and enough half-baked, politically incorrect philosophizing to outweigh a White Castle value meal. Starring John Cho (\"American Dreamz,\" \"American Pie\" trilogy), Kal Penn (\"Epic Movie,\" \"Superman Returns\"), Eddie Kaye Thomas (\"American Pie\" trilogy), David Krumholtz (\"Superbad,\" \"10 Things I Hate About You\") and Emmy and Golden Globe-nominee Neil Patrick Harris (TV's \"How I Met Your Mother,\" TV's \"Doogie Howser\") as Himself."},

"longDescription":"In the tradition of The Princess Diaries, Disney's Freaky Friday is the extremely funny and heartwarming comedy everyone will love. Dr. Tess Coleman (the hilarious Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (rockin' Lindsay Lohan) have one thing in common -- they don't relate to each other on anything. Not clothes or men or Anna's passion to be in a rock band. Nothing. Then one night a little mystic mayhem changes their lives and they wake up to the biggest freak-out ever. Tess and Anna are trapped inside each other's body! But Tess's wedding is Saturday and the two must find a way to switch back -- fast! Literally forced to walk in each other's shoes, will they gain respect and understanding for the other's point of view? Filled with comedy, rock 'n roll and lots of heart, Freaky Friday is freaking fun everyone can enjoy together."},

Their last adventure found them traveling across country to find a White Castle hamburger in order to satisfy a weed- induced case of “the munchies.” This time, the boys get themselves in trouble trying to sneak a bong onboard a flight to Amsterdam.
