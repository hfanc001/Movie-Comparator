"longDescription":"History comes alive in the unforgettable epic motion picture Pearl Harbor, the spectacular blockbuster brought to the screen by Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay. Astounding visual and audio effects put you at the center of the event that changed the world -- that early Sunday morning in paradise when warplanes screamed across the peaceful skies of Pearl Harbor and jolted America into World War II. This real-life tale of catastrophic defeat, heroic victory, and personal courage focuses on the war's devastating impact on two daring young pilots, Ben Affleck (Armageddon) and Josh Hartnet (Black Hawk Down), and a beautiful, dedicated nurse, Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity). Pearl Harbor is extraordinary moviemaking -- a breathtaking reenactment of the \"date which will live in infamy\" and a heartfelt tribute to the men and women who lived it."},

The movie stars John Cho (American Pie I & II, American Dreamz) as Harold and Kal Penn (Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj, Epic Movie) as Kumar, two stoners who can't seem to get a break. Their last adventure found them traveling across country to find a White Castle hamburger in order to satisfy a weed-induced case of \"the munchies.\" This time, the boys get themselves in trouble trying to sneak a bong on board a flight to Amsterdam. Now, being suspected of terrorism, they are forced to run from the law and try to find a way to prove their innocence. What follows is an irreverent and epic journey of deep thoughts, deeper inhaling and a wild trip around the world that is as \"un-PC\" as it gets."},

Starring the explosive talents of Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Academy Award®-winners Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting) and Billy Bob Thornton (Sling Blade), Liv Tyler (The Lord of the Rings trilogy), Steve Buscemi (Con Air), and Will Patton (Gone In 60 seconds), Armageddon is a meteor storm of action-adventure moviemaking that has you on the edge of your seat forgetting to breathe! When NASA's Executive Director, Dan Truman (Thornton), realizes the earth has 18 days before it's obliterated by a meteor the size of Texas, he has only one option -- land a ragtag team of roughneck oil drillers on the asteroid and drop a nuclear warhead into its core. Spectacular special effects, laugh-out-loud humor, great characters, riveting storytelling, and heartfelt emotion make Armageddon an exhilarating thrill ride you'll want to experience like there's no tomorrow."},
