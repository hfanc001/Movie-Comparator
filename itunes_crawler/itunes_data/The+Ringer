"longDescription":"Pressured by a greedy uncle (Brian Cox) and a pile of debt, lovable loser Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) resorts to an unthinkable, contemptible, just-crazy-enough-to-work scheme. He pretends to be mentally challenged to rig the upcoming Special Olympics and bring home the gold. But when Steve's fellow competitors get wise to the con, they inspire him to rise to the greatest challenge of all: becoming a better person. Produced by the fearless Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal), The Ringer will keep you smiling all the way to the finish line!"},

They tried to start a family and were unable to — and have decided they’re okay with that. But as Josh labors over the umpteenth edit of his cerebral new film, it’s plain that he has hit a dry patch and that something is still missing. Enter Jamie (Adam Driver) and Darby (Amanda Seyfried), a free-spirited young couple, who are spontaneous and untethered, ready to drop everything in pursuit of their next passion — retro board games one day, acquiring a pet chicken the next. For Josh, it’s as if a door has opened back to his youth — or a youth he wishes he once had. It’s not long before the restless forty-somethings, Josh and Cornelia, throw aside friends their own age — including Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz in a sly supporting role — to trail after these young hipsters who seem so plugged in, so uninhibited, so Brooklyn cool. “Before we met,” Josh admits to Jamie, “the only two feelings I had left were wistful and disdainful.” But is this new inspiration enough to sustain collaboration and friendship with a couple twenty years their junior? While We’re Young is an openly funny cross-generational comedy of manners about aging, ambition and success, as well as a moving portrait of a marriage tested by the invading forces of youth. No film has better captured the weird, upended logic of urban sophisticates: the older ones embracing their iPads and Netflix, the young ones craving vinyl records and vintage VHS tapes. Powered by Stiller and Driver's note-perfect lead performances and loose, comic turns by Watts and Seyfried, While We’re Young is a complete pleasure to watch.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"From director Joel Schumacher (\"Phone Booth,\" \"A Time to Kill\") comes this big-screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's smash-hit stage musical! The Phantom, a disfigured musical genius, haunts the catacombs beneath the Paris Opera, waging a reign of terror over its occupants. He takes an interest in a young singer and, through tutelage and terror, helps her rise to stardom, only to see her fall in love with a handsome young man. The Phantom vows revenge and kidnaps her to be his eternal bride, but ultimately is transformed by the compassion of the young woman, and the love she feels for her young man, making the ultimate sacrifice in order that she may live and be happy. Starring Gerard Butler (\"300,\" \"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life\"), Emmy Rossum (\"The Day After Tomorrow,\" \"Mystic River\"), Oscar-nominee Miranda Richardson (\"The Hours,\" \"Sleepy Hollow\"), Emmy and Golden Globe-nominee Patrick Wilson (\"Hard Candy,\" TV's \"Angels in America\"), Simon Callow (\"Shakespeare in Love\") and CiarÃ¡n Hinds (\"Road to Perdition,\" \"The Sum of All Fears\").

A candid confessional, told from Barney's point of view, the film spans three decades and two continents, taking us through the different ―acts of his unusual history. There is his first wife, Clara, a flame-haired, flagrantly unfaithful free spirit with whom Barney briefly lives la vie de Boheme in Rome. The \"Second Mrs. Panofsky\" is a wealthy Jewish Princess who shops and talks incessantly, barely noticing that Barney is not listening. And it is at their lavish wedding that Barney meets, and starts pursuing, Miriam, his third wife, the mother of his two children, and his true love. With his father, Izzy as his sidekick, Barney takes us through the many highs, and a few too many lows, of his long and colorful life. Not only does Barney turn out to be a true romantic, he is also capable of all kinds of sneaky acts of gallantry, generosity, and goodness when we – and he least expect it. His is a gloriously full life, played out on a grand scale. And, at its center stands an unlikely hero – the unforgettable Barney Panofsky."},
