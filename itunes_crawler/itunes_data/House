What looks like a possible brain tumor does not respond to treatment and provides many more questions than answers for House and his team as they engage in a risky trial-and-error approach to her case.  When the young teacher refuses any additional variations of treatment and her life starts slipping away, House must act against his code of conduct and make a personal visit to his patient to convince her to trust him one last time."},

House's new case is 7-year-old Clancy, a product of in-vitro fertilization, who's been admitted to the hospital with rectal bleeding and proclamations of being tortured by aliens. As the team runs tests on him, they discover the same test is giving conflicting results. When Clancy claims to have a tracking device in the back of his neck and the team discovers an unknown metal object exactly in that spot, they aren't quite sure what to think. Amidst all this weirdness, Cuddy and Wilson decide it would be best not to tell House the truth about his last case, thinking that perhaps he will learn some humility if he believes he's not always right. Cameron discovers the lie and is outraged, but Cuddy convinces her to hold off telling House. When House and the team discover cells with a different type of DNA in Clancy's body, they are forced to give Clancy's alien claims a little more credence, but a frustrated House gives up on his young patient, forcing Cuddy to re-think her desire to hold back the truth she's hiding."},

Cuddy and Wilson also are convinced House is creating a mystery out of Richard's case to cure his own boredom, but he denies it and becomes more frustrated when his theories do not point to a cure for Richard, forcing House to face an unpleasant truth."},

Shortly after takeoff, a passenger seated next to House becomes violently ill. While House brushes it off as a hangover, Cuddy suspects the man might have a deadly contagious virus and the other passengers could be at risk. Assuming the worst, Cuddy suggests the plane turn back and land, but House dissuades the flight attendant and the flight continues on. As the man's condition worsens, the rest of the passengers on the flight become increasingly uneasy, and so does House when a second passenger falls ill with the exact same rash and debilitating symptoms. Back at Princeton-Plainsboro, Wilson leads the team when they encounter Fran, a middle-aged woman who collapsed at her home and soon goes into seizures. Cameron and Chase investigate Fran's house to look for clues to a diagnosis, but they are distracted by the prospect of an empty house and an inviting bed. When they return empty-handed and Fran's health continues to decline, the team must focus on finding out what is killing Fran without House's help. Back on the flight, with First Class turned into a makeshift isolation area, House calls upon a misfit team of passengers to fill in for his own team, as he bounces questions and theories off of them. When Cuddy collapses and several more passengers fall ill, the situation turns dire as the plane is hours away from any viable landing place. Without the help of his team or even proper medical equipment, House finds himself with Cuddy's life and a plane-full of passengers' lives in his hands."},

With Nick's immune system completely wiped out from chemotherapy, Wilson is extremely cautious about keeping him healthy before the transplant. However, when Matty sneezes during a pre-op visit to his brother, Wilson knows that Matty is not healthy enough to donate. House and the team race to find out what is making Matty sick so that they can treat him quickly and allow him to donate healthy, uninfected bone marrow to his dying brother. With no other matching donors available, the team knows that Matty is their best shot at saving Nick's life, since giving Nick bone marrow from a partial-match donor could lead to an excruciating death if Nick's body rejected it. House decides they must purposefully make Matty sicker and use his developing symptoms as a method of narrowing the diagnosis field. As both brothers' conditions worsen and Nick has only days to live, the team must diagnose and treat Matty before it's too late for both brothers. Meanwhile, Foreman is haunted by his mistake that killed a patient just one week earlier, and House only wishes he could incur similar misfortune upon his new pet and nemesis, Hector."},

The team wonders why House is taking the case – the boy's not sick; his symptoms seem to be a product of his autism. House claims he just wants a patient who can't lie, but it seems he relates to this kid: the social aloofness, the obsession with detail, the lack of social graces. In fact, House actually envies him; living in a shell has its advantages. But when Cuddy makes a minor change to House's office and House refuses to use the office until it's returned to its original state, he finds himself wandering the hospital in need of a temporary home, crashing in Cuddy and Wilson's offices. Meanwhile, teenager Ali from the previous episode still has a crush on House and is becoming a nuisance around the hospital. As Adam becomes more ill and the torturous diagnostic procedures yield nothing, House realizes he needs an answer, and his patient just might be the only one who can give him one. House finds he has to break through the very shell he admires in order to get anything out of the boy."},

From his unique perspective, we hear Lee's inner thoughts as House, injured in a motorcycle accident, occupies the hospital bed next to him. House takes notice of Lee as his doctor writes him off as being brain-dead and begins to arrange his organ donations. However, House confirms that Lee is not brain dead at all, but rather has \"locked-in\" syndrome – he is completely conscious but unable to let anyone know. As House develops a system to communicate with Lee by having him blink once for \"no\" and twice for \"yes,\" he is intrigued by the case and tries to figure out what is causing Lee's condition, much to the disdain of the presiding physician. When House gets Lee transferred to Princeton Plainsboro, the team is on the case to try to save Lee. As we learn more about Lee and his family, we also see House and the team through Lee's unique perspective, lending insight into their not-so-transparent relationships. When Lee loses his ability to blink and continues to fall ill, the team must race to find the key to unlock his condition. Meanwhile, Wilson suspects House is hiding something from him when he refuses to divulge why he was in New York when he got into his motorcycle accident."},

As they try to determine whether the man's pain is psychosomatic or caused by a physical disease, parallels between the patient and House's experiences with excruciating, prolonged pain become apparent. When the patient again attempts suicide under the team's care, their search for answers becomes urgent. Meanwhile, Foreman and Thirteen explore their now complicated relationship as they work together on the Huntington's disease clinical drug trial, and Cuddy finds that taking care of her newly adopted baby leaves her little time to run a hospital and baby-sit House at the same time."},

Tests reveal the boy has genetic mosaicism, or both male and female DNA, and the boy's parents inform House and the team that the boy is unaware of his condition.

Meanwhile, Cuddy and Wilson suspect something is wrong with House when he starts acting way too nicely. When they discover the shocking answer, they must face the prospect that House may be changed forever."}]
