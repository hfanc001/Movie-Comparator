"longDescription":"Emmy Award-winner Peter Falk (\"Columbo,\" \"The Princess Bride\") and Academy Award-winner Alan Arkin (\"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Slums of Beverly Hills\") are brilliantly funny in this zany comedy about a dentist and a \"CIA Agent,\" and their riotous misadventures on the eve of their children's wedding. Written by Andrew Bergman (\"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Blazing Saddles\"), and co-starring Academy Award-nominee David Paymer (\"Alex & Emma,\" \"State & Main\"), Ed Begley, Jr. (\"The Accidental Tourist\") and Nancy Dussault (TV's \"Too Close for Comfort\"). A runaway boxoffice hit, this film was directed by Academy Award-honoree Andrew Hiller (\"Carpool,\" \"Silver Streak\")."},
