"longDescription":"World-renowned magician, Ricky Jay, is embraced by both audiences and fellow magicians alike, provoking astonishment in even the most skeptical of viewers. Featuring rare footage from his 1970s TV appearances (doing 3-card Monte with Steve Martin on The Dinah Shore Show) and told in Jay's inimitable voice, this is a remarkable journey inside the secretive world of magic, and the small circle of eccentrics who are its perpetual devotees."}]
