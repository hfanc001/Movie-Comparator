"longDescription":"From Academy Award-winning director Oliver Stone (\"Any Given Sunday,\" \"Platoon\") comes this epic story of Alexander the Great, the King of Macedonia and one of the greatest military leaders in the history of warfare, who over an eight year period managed to conquer 90% of the known world of his time by age 25. This story chronicles Alexander's path to becoming a living legend, from a youth fueled by dreams of myth, glory, and adventure, to his intense bonds with his closest companions, to his lonely death as a ruler of a vast empire - an incredible story of a life that united the Known World and proved that, if nothing else, fortune favors the bold.

But when Alexander tells his upbeat family about the misadventures of his disastrous day, he finds little sympathy and begins to wonder if bad things only happen to him. He soon learns that he’s not alone when his mom (Jennifer Garner), dad (Steve Carell), brother (Dylan Minnette) and sister (Kerris Dorsey) all find themselves living through their own terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. Anyone who says there is no such thing as a bad day just hasn't had one.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Walter Keane (two time Academy Award®-winner Christoph Waltz of DJANGO UNCHAINED) revolutionized the commercialization of popular art with enigmatic paintings of waifs with big eyes. But soon the shocking truth was discovered: Walter's works were not painted by him at all, but by his wife Margaret (five time Oscar®-nominee Amy Adams of AMERICAN HUSTLE). BIG EYES focuses on the success of Margaret's paintings and her tumultuous relationship with her husband, who catapulted to international fame while taking credit for her work.

When word of the disaster reaches the U.S. Coast Guard, four men led by Captain Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) set out in a 12-seat boat on a daring mission to rescue the stranded men, braving freezing cold, 60-foot waves and hurricane-force winds, and guided by Webber’s vow that “We all live, or we all die.” Packed with thrilling, larger-than-life action and anchored in a belief in the strength of the human spirit, The Finest Hours is a triumph.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"The year is 2018. An army of Terminators roams the post-apocalyptic landscape, killing or collecting humans. But small groups of survivors have organized into a Resistance, hiding in underground bunkers and striking when they can. Controlling the Terminators is the artificial intelligence network Skynet, which became self-aware 14 years earlier and, in the blink of an eye, turned on its creators, unleashing nuclear annihilation on an unsuspecting world. The world is on the brink of the future that John Connor (Christian Bale) has been warned about all his life. But something totally new has shaken his belief that humanity stands a chance of winning this war: the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger from the past. Connor must decide whether Marcus can be trusted. But as Skynet adapts new strategies to end the Resistance forever, Connor and Marcus must find common ground to take a stand against the onslaught--to infiltrate Skynet and meet the enemy head-on."},
