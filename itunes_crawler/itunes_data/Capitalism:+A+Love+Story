"longDescription":"Exactly one year and a day after the initial Wall Street bailout, Michael Moore (SICKO, FAHRENHEIT 9/11) looks at the global financial crisis and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. In standard Moore fashion, he mockingly draws attention to the Wall Street and Government decisions that have enabled what he calls “the biggest robbery in the history of this country.”"}]
