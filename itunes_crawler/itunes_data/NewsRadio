A fire has stranded a subway train between stations, leaving its 35 passengers in the dark and smoky tunnel.

While Bill is certain he'll want to understand what drives him to do his job, all Caan wants is to watch him at work.

Then, as Catherine and Beth are quizzed for the right to the basketball tickets, Dave unveils his present for Lisa...her first television set. But they quickly part ways over the question of the intelligence of TV viewers.  As Bill tries getting him interested in the deeper meaning of being a radio announcer, James becomes fascinated with Matthew's unusual behavior. And once Bill accuses him of trying to steal the actor's attention, Matthew offers to go home to avoid being a distraction, but only after nervously getting an autograph. Meanwhile, when Lisa discovers there's a channel that carries congressional hearings 24-hours a day, she immediately decides that she wants a television. And when Jimmy offers to buy an extra ticket so he can take them both, Catherine and Beth have second thoughts after seeing just how big a fan he really is."},

As Jimmy, Dave and Bill struggle to agree on a new spot, Beth inquires about subletting her share of the summer home. While Matthew is quick to encourage her idea, Catherine makes it clear that she doesn't want to spend her summer weekends with a bunch of strangers, not to mention one with Bill running around in a skimpy bathing suit. Meanwhile, Beth pitches in to help Joe prepare for his exam.  As a condition of Lisa's participation, Matthew guarantees that she and Dave will be scheduled to use the summer house on alternate weekends. Yet, Dave's hoping to use the house as a chance to revive their relationship and wants to be scheduled on the same weekends. Once it becomes clear that Matthew has been less than honest with them, the staff sells their shares in the house to anyone they can find. Finally, after a long day of editing produces a very, very brief promo, Joe gets a passing grade, but only after saving his professor from a stalled elevator."},

But Dave is sure he can handle it with a staff meeting.  When the meeting is a dismal failure, Dave discovers his staff would welcome a visit by the ever-popular Dr. Frank Westford. And when he arrives to the staff's warm welcome, even Bill is more than willing to respond to the affable therapist. Though Lisa suggests some therapy may help him, too, Dave is concerned to learn Dr. Frank was her college psychology professor. But it's not until their session is getting underway that he's told of their student-teacher affair.  Even after seeing how much he's helped the staff, Dave continues to balk at a session of his own. Yet once Dr. Frank lures him into conversation, Dave suddenly realizes the value of therapy, too. However, it's Dr. Frank who finds himself on the couch when, as he's questioned by Dave about the relationship with Lisa, he admits to having an incurable addiction to sex. Finally, despite their suggestion that he tear down the walls of his cubicle, a look inside convinces Dave and Dr. Frank that Bill needs a little more time."},

Lisa and Dave think she's just being paranoid, so Beth suggests an experiment which could prove her claim. Meanwhile, after leaving his identification card at his desk, Bill is denied entry by a pair of the building's security guards.  To prove her point, Beth suggests to Sandi that she is romantically interested in Matthew. As predicted, Sandi then makes an obvious pass at him as well. And while Matthew isn't sure what to make of all the attention, Dave and Lisa see that Beth was right. Meanwhile, as the security guards continue to foil Bill's attempts to sneak inside, Catherine decides to have some fun by getting into the act, too.  Disgusted by Sandi's flirtatious behavior, Beth ups the ante in her little game by giving Matthew a big kiss. So Matthew seeks Lisa's advice on how to handle the two women who seem to be in love with him. But when Beth decides to put an end to the charade and confronts her about the mimicry, Sandi finally admits she only did it out of envy and admiration. Upon making up, they each let Matthew down gently with some help from Dave, while Bill recovers his ID for the benefit of the guards, only to discover it's expired."},
