"longDescription":"A lot is riding on Col. O'Neill's \"fron\" - the Ancient word for head: Having had the repository of Ancient knowledge downloaded into his mind, he now, hopefully, will soon know the secret location of The Lost City of the Ancients, where the power to defeat Anubis is thought to lie. And with Anubis and his super-drone army rapidly approaching Earth, SG-1 can only pray that O'Neill will \"go Ancient\" soon - even though everyone sadly knows that when that happens, O'Neill's physical composition won't be able to stand the transition for long, and he will die.  The process seems to have already begun: Dr. Daniel Jackson notices O'Neill has written some Ancient words into a crossword puzzle he was trying to finish while he can still read English. Daniel discerns that they are not words but syllables of two words - Praclarush Taonas, the planet where the Lost City lies. But Daniel also figures out that each syllable also is a clue to the planet's stargate address - one they tried dialing two years ago without success. That means the stargate is buried. Maj. Carter can use the address to chart the planet's position in space, but they'll have to travel there by ship. Dr. Elizabeth Weir - the newly installed head of Stargate Command - reminds them that the starship Prometheus can't be taken now, as it is Earth's last line of defense against Anubis.  Teal'c and Bra'tac, however, have procured an unarmed interstellar cargo ship on Chulak. The ship was stolen from Anubis by a free Jaffa named Ronan, who joins them in their mission. They and SG-1 travel to Praclarush Taonas with a load of equipment that O'Neill has packed without knowing why. O'Neill also senses they're not traveling fast enough, and he modifies the engines in a way that even Carter can't fathom. She tells O'Neill she has authorization to take control of the team if she determines his brain has become too overwritten with Ancient consciousness.  He tells her to take command now.  Anubis begins the attack on Earth. An American aircraft carrier and a battle cruiser are destroyed by one of his ships. Communications across the planet are knocked out. Vice-President Kinsey runs to Stargate Command to 'gate to the Alpha Site. At the White House, President Hayes - who has been meeting with top officials, including Gen. Hammond, and has spoken with a projection of Anubis himself - tells his team to stand and fight. He orders the Prometheus to launch."},

"shortDescription":"SG teams 1, 3, and 5 go off-world to attempt the extraction of an Ancient repository device. Upon arrival, Goa'uld ships fire on SG-1. With no other way to keep Anubis from claiming the knowledge for himself, Jack submits to the dangerous device.", 
"longDescription":"Dr. Daniel Jackson makes an amazing discovery while translating the Ancient writing on the colonnade that SG-2 discovered on planet P3X-439. The writing talks about a library of knowledge and Daniel suspects it contains a repository - the same type of device that once downloaded the Ancients' knowledge into Col. O'Neill's brain and would have cost O'Neill his life had not the Asgard intervened and removed the alien data from his mind.  However, SG-2 spots a Goa'uld reconnaissance drone while on the planet, which means that system lord Anubis is also aware of the repository's existence. SG-1 must get to it first, so that they can, once and for all, learn the location of the Lost City of the Ancients and use that race's advanced technology to save the galaxy from Goa'uld oppression. Should this knowledge fall into Anubis' hands, nothing will be able to stop him. This time, SG-1's plan is to remove the repository rather than downloading it into a human, and then to bring it back to Earth and find a safe way to retrieve the data. The Asgard and other alien allies are not responding, so Stargate Command is on its own.  SG-1, SG-2 and SG-3 are dispatched to P3X-439, where Daniel and Maj. Carter try to remove the repository from the monument - with no luck. Suddenly, a full-scale Goa'uld attack rocks the monument, as Alkesh fighters carpet-bomb the area. There is no choice: Someone must download the Ancient knowledge into his or her brain. O'Neill assesses that Carter is too valuable, and that Daniel will be needed to translate the Ancient language that whoever goes through with this will be speaking when their consciousness is taken over and replaced by that of the Ancients - resulting in neural overload and death. So he does it again: O'Neill steps up to the repository, where the face-hugging arms come out, grab O'Neill's head and pump Ancient knowledge directly into his brain.  The teams return to Stargate Command, where they must face the inevitable: O'Neill's human consciousness will soon be obliterated and he will begin speaking in Ancient. Not long after that, his human physiology will no longer be able to handle the strain and he will die."},

"longDescription":"A team of field investigators uncovers the clues that will recreate vanished or hidden worlds. They use the latest research, expert analysis and cutting edge graphic technology to take us back. In 1939 a group of scientists -- Albert Einstein among them - warned President Roosevelt, of the possibility that Hitler's Germany might be close to producing an atomic bomb. Roosevelt issued an order -- whatever it takes, the US has to be the first to develop an atomic bomb. And within three years they were well on their way to creating a hidden world of secret cities and classified nuclear facilities, built inside America. 400,000 people were part of it -- though only a handful really knew the truth. Six decades later, a team of experts return to the once-classified sites where the course of history was decided. In top secret cities and nuclear facilities, they uncover and rebuild this lost world. Requiring half a million acres of land, billions of dollars and the construction of the largest building in the world, three top secret cities were built in isolated parts of Tennessee, New Mexico and Washington State. This was to be the most costly and most labor intensive engineering program ever undertaken. Using eyewitness testimony and cutting edge graphic technology, we recreate the secret world of the Manhattan Project today."},
