"longDescription":"Based on the international best-selling novel, The Girl Who Played With Fire is the explosive follow-up to the literary and cinematic hit The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. In this second installment of Stieg Larsson’s phenomenal “Millennium” trilogy, Lisbeth Salander is a wanted woman. A researcher and a Millennium journalist about to expose the truth about the sex trade in Sweden are brutally murdered and Salander’s prints are on the weapon. Her history of unpredictable and violent behavior makes her an official danger to society. Mikael Blomkvist, Salander’s friend and Millennium’s publisher, is alone in his belief of Salander’s innocence. Digging deeper, Blomkvist unearths evidence implicating highly placed members of Swedish society – as well as shocking details about Salander’s past. He is desperate to get to her before she is cornered – but no one can find her anywhere."},

But perhaps more shocking for Blomkvist: the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to Lisbeth Salander. <br /><br />Now, as Blomkvist, alone in his belief in her innocence, plunges into his own investigation of the slayings, Salander is drawn into a murderous hunt in which she is the prey, and which compels her to revisit her dark past in an effort to settle with it once and for all."},
