These four brothers who hailed from Arkansas grew up to be some of the most notorious drug lords in America, with profits that exceeded $50 million a year. They had become so popular that even former President Bill Clinton mentioned them during a speech at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Crack made them all very wealthy men, but it also made them cocky and careless. Although they are now behind bars, their impact lingers on. At the time of their sentencing in 1988, the Detroit-based Chambers Brothers had more than 400 people on their team. The sons of sharecroppers, this fascinating episode will fully detail each brother's path to crime and the one incident that eventually brought them down."},

For over two decades, during the rise of Black power in cities across America, the reputed Black Mafia reigned through fear tactics and cold-blooded determination. Their crimes would stretch from Washington, DC to New Jersey. In what was described as a vicious circle, the very motto that helped the Philly Black Mafia rise also broke down the gangster bond. Even victims of the Black Mafia were unwilling to testify to the brutality and control these gangsters held over the city of Philadelphia."},

"longDescription":"Before he became one of America's most famous death row inmates, Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams' was best known as the co-founder of the Crips, a notorious Los Angeles gang that has terrorized the streets of South Central for more than 30 years. Williams initially despised gangs, but was determined to defend his turf during the late '60s. Intent on establishing himself as a leader, Williams dabbled in drugs, burglary and street fights and was constantly in and out of juvenile detention centers. At 17 he determined he wanted to be the leader of the biggest gang in the world and hooked up with another misguided teen, Raymond Washington, to form the Crips. The Crips' crimes were well documented, including the alleged quadruple murder that sent Williams to jail for the rest of his life. In this episode you'll see the two sides of this very complex man - the body-building youth counselor and the cold-blooded killer, and explore Williams' involvement in the Crips, their continuous battles with rival gang the Bloods, and the history of gangs in L.A. from WWII to the present."},

"longDescription":"In the wee hours of the morning on April 6, 2003, four men drilled a hole through the wall of a vacant restaurant in San Francisco's Union Square district that would eventually gain them entry into Lang Estate Jewelers. They spent the night there and when the store?s employees arrived for work that morning they were greeted by the robbers. The four men terrorized the employees at gunpoint and then forced the store's manager to open the safe. They escaped with an estimated $6 million in jewels - the largest haul in San Francisco history. Among the four pulling off this successful heist were brothers Troy and Dino Smith. They were fairly well known to police, and were thought to be suspects in a slew of robberies during the '80s. When they stole, they stole everything. They never played it safe. They even robbed drug dealers. It was all good for a very long time. But their luck ran out shortly after the Lang job."},
