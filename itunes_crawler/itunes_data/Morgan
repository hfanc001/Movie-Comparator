"longDescription":"\"Watchmen (Director's Cut)\" promises 24 extra minutes of action-packed, effects-laden scenes never before seen in theaters! This multi-layered adventure unfolds as scenes present in the graphic novel finally make the leap to film. A complex, multi-layered mystery adventure, \"Watchmen\" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the Doomsday Clock--which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union--moves closer to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion--a disbanded group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers--Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the Watchmen?"},

"longDescription":"\"Dolphin Tale 2\" continues the story of the brave dolphin Winter, whose miraculous rescue and recovery-thanks to a groundbreaking prosthetic tail-made her a symbol of hope and perseverance to people around the world and inspired the 2011 hit movie \"Dolphin Tale.\" It has been several years since young Sawyer Nelson and the dedicated team at the Clearwater Marine Hospital, headed by Dr. Clay Haskett, rescued Winter. Yet their fight is not over. Winter's surrogate mother, the very elderly dolphin Panama, has passed away, leaving Winter without the only poolmate she has ever known. However, the loss of Panama may have even greater repercussions for Winter, who, according to USDA regulations, cannot be housed alone, as dolphins' social behavior requires them to be paired with other dolphins. Time is running out to find a companion for her before the team at Clearwater loses their beloved Winter to another aquarium.", "hasITunesExtras":true}]
