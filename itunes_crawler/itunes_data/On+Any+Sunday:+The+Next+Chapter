"longDescription":"“On Any Sunday, The Next Chapter” is an exploration into the pursuit of excitement, passion, and life in the 2 wheeled world of motorcycle riding. Experiences that are as relatable to a rider as a day with their friends, others that explore human triumph and overcoming fear, and some which occur once in a lifetime. One moment of riding a motorcycle – On Any Sunday. Critically acclaimed director Dana Brown (“Step Into Liquid” and “Dust to Glory”) teams up with his father, Academy Award Nominee Bruce Brown (“Endless Summer” and “On Any Sunday”) to journey deeper into the humanity, thrills and excitement of the global culture of motorcycle riding; those that are bonded by their passion for the race, the thrill of the ride, the love of the family and friendship, and on a deeper level – their quest for the thrill of the next ride. In 1971, “On Any Sunday” starring Steve McQueen opened in theaters and wrote its place in motorcycle history. It also transcended the sport to reach a wide audience through a cast of engaging characters and variety of heartfelt stories. “On Any Sunday, The Next Chapter” will continue this family tradition and also pass the torch to the next generation. A lot has happened in the past 40 years, but the passion for riding is timeless and continues today.", "hasITunesExtras":true}]
