"longDescription":"His drawings and sketches are exhibited and sold worldwide. Beck, Wilco, Sonic Youth and Pearl Jam have recorded his songs. But beneath Daniel Johnston's success as an artist and musician is an incredible story of genius touched by madness: diagnosed as manic-depressive, Johnston has spent the last three decades of his life in-and-out of mental institutions. Told through a compelling combination of interviews, home movies and performance footage, \"The Devil and Daniel Johnston\" is 'a harrowing, hilarious and ultimately moving new documentary film' (Jim Farber, New York Daily News). '****' (Elizabeth Weitzman, New York Daily News)!"}]
