Oliver discovers Vertigo in Diggle's blood and realizes Count Vertigo (recurring guest star SETH GABEL) has broken out of prison and is once again distributing his drug. Meanwhile, Moira goes on trial for her participation in the Undertaking. When ADA Adam Donner collapses in court with Vertigo symptoms, Laurel must step in and try the case against Moira — leaving Oliver torn between standing by his family during the trial or catching Count Vertigo. The stakes change, however, when Felicity follows a lead and walks straight into a trap set by Count Vertigo."},

"longDescription":"Bartlet's third State of the Union speech is a major success. Unfortunately, problems immediately occur that diminish the White House staff's enthusiasm. Sam learns that a policeman whom Bartlet praised during the speech was charged with beating a suspect 17 years ago. Working with calm pollster Joey Lucas, Josh is agitated by the length of time it takes to gauge the public's reaction to the speech, due to an electrical power glitch. Simultaneously, five U.S. drug enforcement officers are taken prisoner by Colombian drug lords. Another difficult issue Bartlet must confront is his wife's angry disappointment. Abbey senses from Bartlet's address that he intends to campaign for a second term, which he had promised her he would not do."},
