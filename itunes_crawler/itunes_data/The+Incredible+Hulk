Bill Bixby portrays scientist David Banner, who, while doing research on the incredible feats of strength accomplished by some individuals during moments of stress, is exposed to a massive dose of gamma rays. He feels no ill effects, but the first time he loses his temper afterwards, he is transformed into a bizarre man-beast nearly seven-feet tall with enormous strength.
