Jules Faroux considers various strategies to get Frank into the building, but every scenario he thinks of would endwith Frank’s death. Agents Cleef and Wolfe of the FBI receive a tip-off that the weapon’s buyer, anti-government terrorist Damian Blake, is arriving at the airport imminently. Frank spots an opportunity: the Triad has never met Blake, so with the help of the FBI, Frank is issued with a fake passport so he can take his place. Blake is arrested at the airport while Frank meets and convinces Tien's driver of his assumed identity. But Blake overcomes the security team at the airport, escapes and alerts the driver. Frank reacts swiftly and is able to knock the driver out. He manages to intercept Blake and hand him over to the FBI. Frank enters the Chinese restaurant still under the guise of Damian Blake and asks to speak to Tien. Blake was to transfer $30 million for the weapon via a secret bank account, which requires a ten-digit code. The FBI has a spy working on the inside, and Frank is to receive the code from him. But now Agent Wolfe admits the danger Frank is in — she suspects there is a mole working within the FBI to help Blake secure the weapon. Caterina and Jules begin to suspect Agent Cleef is the mole after Jules discovers he accessed a secret bank account the previous night."},

Frank and Jules Faroux arrive at the stables just as an armed intruder has broken in and is attacking the stable’s security guard and Daksha’s jockey, Alice Budd. Frank and Jules intervene but the attacker escapes. Although there is little proof, both Alice and Daksha’s owner, Rae Henson, believe the attack is somehow linked to casino and fellow racehorse owner, Howard Woyczyk. Before beginning their 12 hour journey, Frank surreptitiously moves Daksha from one vehicle to another in order to maintain secrecy and goads the assailant-at-large into following them. After a car chase, the masked attacker is caught and revealed to be Tommy Sands, who worked as a horse trainer for Rae’s father before he began sabotaging horses for money. Frank is all too aware that anyone could be a suspect at the moment, particularly as Rae is in real financial difficultly herself. Rae fiercely denies this accusation and decides to call Woyczyk, angrily demanding they meet alone. Howard offers her a deal: he will have fake bets placed on his own racehorse through his internet betting sites, which he will then split in half with her if she agrees to let his horse, Snowclash win the Belmont. Rae cannot hide the temptation, but she refuses to comply."},
