"longDescription":"How to Eat Fried Worms tells the story of Billy (Luke Benward - \"We Were Soldiers,\" \"Because of Winn-Dixie\"), an 11-year old who, on his first day at a new school, inadvertently challenges the town bully. To save face and earn the respect of his new classmates, Billy agrees to a bet -- whether he can eat 10 worms in 1 day -- that will determine his fate at the school. As the pressure mounts, he must summon heroic strength to keep his 5-year-old brother from blabbing, his weak stomach from betraying him, and his big mouth from getting him into more trouble than he's already in. Starring Golden Globe-nominee Tom Cavanaugh (TV's \"Ed,\" \"Bang Bang You're Dead\"), Kimberly Williams-Paisley (\"Father of the Bride I &amp; II,\" \"We Are Marshall\"), James Rebhorn (\"Scent of a Woman,\" \"Baby Mama\"), and Hallie Kate Eisenberg (\"The Insider,\" \"Bicentennial Man\")."},
