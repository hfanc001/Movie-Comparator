"longDescription":"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, is a film that grabs life by the ball. Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe’s. The facility’s clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is made up of a self-styled pirate, a scrawny nerd (Justin Long) who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader, an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports, a dim-witted young man, and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter’s humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe’s, and Peter’s non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe’s to finalize Globo’s takeover of the gym. Peter’s boyish charm wins her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds."},
