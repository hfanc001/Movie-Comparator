"longDescription":"Whether trodding the boards for paying audiences or performing at the kitchen table for her theatrical family (father Jack Heller, mother Diane Salinger, uncle David Proval, guest boarder Harriet Schock) the only place Pandora Isaacs, nicknamed Panda, (Tanna Frederick) has ever felt truly safe and entirely at home is on a stage. Stinging from the latest of several romantic break-ups, she retreats to the safety of her parents' ramshackle upstate country house - just 45 minutes from Broadway - where her non-theatrical sister (Julie Davis) and her sister's fianc√©, a real-estate executive, (Judd Nelson) are also arriving for the weekend and the family's yearly Passover Seder. Family secrets, sibling rivalries, theatrical hysterics and the possibility of true love as rare as a blue bullfrog all emerge. But is this a play Panda is in or is it \"real life?\" Like so many actors, she is not entirely sure she knows the difference."}]
