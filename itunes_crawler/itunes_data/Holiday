However, six-year-old Susan Walker (Mara Wilson) has doubts about childhood's most enduring miracle...Santa Claus. This holiday season, Susan is going to receive the most precious gift of all: something to believe in.

"longDescription":"Audrey Hepburn's Oscar-winning performance in her first starring role. Roman Holiday was nominated for ten Academy Awards, and Audrey Hepburn captured an Oscar for her portrayal of a modern-day princess, rebelling against the royal obligations, who explores Rome on her own. She meets Gregory Peck, an American newspaperman who, seeking an exclusive story, pretends ignorance of her true identity. But his plan falters as they fall in love. Eddie Albert contributes to the fun as Peck's carefree cameraman pal. Stylishly directed by William Wyler, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

In this darkly comic updating of Charles Dicken's Christmas classic \"A Christmas Carol,\" Bill Murray portrays Frank Cross, an evil, crass, executive who caters to the lowest-of-the-lowest common denominators, firing people whenever he wants to and for the flimsiest of reasons. Therefore, to change his cruel and tasteless ways, Cross is taken on a trip through his past to his future, accompanied by ghosts David Johansen and Carol Kane, so that he can achieve redemption."},
