"longDescription":"One of the greatest love stories of all time, Pride & Prejudice, comes to the screen in a glorious new adaptation starring Keira Knightley. When Elizabeth Bennett (Knightley) meets the handsome Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), she believes he is the last man on earth she could ever marry. But as their lives become intertwined in an unexpected adventure, she finds herself captivated by the very person she swore to loathe for all eternity. Based on the beloved masterpiece by Jane Austen, it is the classic tale of love and misunderstanding that sparkles with romance, wit and emotional force. Critics are calling it \"Exhilarating. A joy from start to finish\" (Carina Chocano, Los Angeles Times)."},

The contents leave Elizabeth reeling. Wickham, far from being hard done by, was a loose-living scoundrel who had no intention of joining the church and had instead accepted £5,000 in compensation.Worse, he had tried to elope with Georgiana, Darcy’s 15-year-old sister, just to gain access to her fortune of £30,000. Darcy had only just arrived in time to foil him. Obviously, Darcy had good cause for his behaviour towards Wickham, but Elizabeth can only shake her head in sorrow and disagreement as she reads that, when he separated Bingley from Jane, he believed her to be indifferent to him."},

"description":"\"His perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!\"<br />\r\n<i>Pride and Prejudice<\/i> has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly by its captivating wisdom."},

"description":"This classic and groundbreaking novel by Jane Austen (16th December 1775  -  18th July 1817) depicts a young woman's quest for love, surrounded by the themes and issues of the early 19th century. What is perhaps most surprising are the similarities with modern life and its the novel's continuing influence today.<br /><br />Austen never married and lived her entire life amongst her close family members, who were amongst the lower fringes of the English gentry - similar to that of the characters in <i>Pride \u0097 Prejudice<\/i>. Interestingly, Austin was not given much credit at the time for her works, and it was only after her death that critics and scholars begin to recognize her importance to English literature. This abridged recording is read for you by Neil Conrich."},

"description":"One of Jane Austen’s most beloved works, <i>Pride and Prejudice<\/i>, is vividly brought to life by Academy Award nominee Rosamund Pike (<i>Gone Girl<\/i>). In her bright and energetic performance of this British classic, she expertly captures Austen’s signature wit and tone. Her attention to detail, her literary background, and her performance in the 2005 feature film version of the novel provide the perfect foundation from which to convey the story of Elizabeth Bennett, her four sisters, and the inimitable Mr. Darcy. <br /><br />In <i>Pride and Prejudice<\/i>, the Bennett sisters try to find their way in the repressive strictures of 19th-century society. Austen shows the folly of judging by first impressions and the experience of falling in love, and she superbly describes a world which, despite being more than two centuries old, still resonates with modern concerns."},

"description":"Many consider this rich social commentary to be Jane Austen's finest novel. It is certainly among her more famous ones. Austen sets her entertaining study of manners and misconceptions against the backdrop of a class-conscious society in 18th century England.<br />Spirited, intelligent Elizabeth Bennett is alternately enchanted and affronted by Mr. Darcy. She is quick to suspend her usual, more rational judgment when it comes to him. She also is quick to believe the worst gossip about this haughty, opinionated man who soon manages to alienate Elizabeth and her family. But is the condescending air that Mr. Darcy wears an indication of his real character? Or has Elizabeth's pride gotten in the way of her chance for true romance?"},
