"longDescription":"In a small, remote mountain top primary school in the Kenyan bush, hundreds of children are jostling for a chance for the free education newly promised by the Kenyan government. One new applicant causes astonishment when he knocks on the door of the school. He is Maruge (Litondo), an old Mau Mau veteran in his eighties, who is desperate to learn to read at this late stage of his life. He fought for the liberation of his country and now feels he must have the chance of an education so long denied - even if it means sitting in a classroom alongside six-year-olds. Moved by his passionate plea, head teacher Jane Obinchu (Harris), supports his struggle to gain admission and together they face fierce opposition from parents and officials who don't want to waste a precious school place on such an old man. Full of vitality and humor, the film explores the remarkable relationships Maruge builds with his classmates some eighty years his junior. Through Maruge's journey, we are taken back to the shocking untold story of British colonial rule 50 years earlier where Maruge fought for the freedom of his country, eventually ending up in the extreme and harsh conditions of the British detention camps. THE FIRST GRADER is a heart-warming and inspiring true story of one man's fight for what he believes is his right in order to overcome the burdens of his past. It is a triumphant testimony to the transforming force of education."},

"description":"Junie B. does her best, but life just has so many interesting possibilities, which often land her in trouble with the teacher and her parents. No matter how mixed-up things get, one thing's for sure, you'll have a good laugh listening to Junie B.'s adventures!<br /> <b>Junie B., First Grader: Shipwrecked<\/b><br /> Ship Ahoy! Room One is putting on a play. And guess what? It's about explorers looking for the New World! And there's ships and sea captains and everything! Plus here's the bestest news of all, Junie B. Jones thinks she might be the star of the whole entire production! Only, sailing the ocean blue is not as easy as it looks, apparently. 'Cause problems keep on happening. Like the actors keep catching the flu. And bossy May keeps trying to take over the show. Can this play be saved? Will the ships ever get to land? Or is Room One in for a disaster at sea that they will never forget?<br /><br /> <b>Junie B., First Grader: Boo...and I MEAN It!<\/b><br /> It's Halloween! Only here's the trouble. Junie B. Jones is afraid to go trick-or-treating. 'Cause what if witches and monsters are really real? And what if pumpkins with sharp teeth can eat your feet? And don't even get her started on the candy corn problem. So how is Junie B. supposed to even enjoy this scary holiday? But then, with a little help from a friend, she gets an idea for a costume guaranteed to outscare even the creepiest competition. And so maybe Halloween will turn out to be a real scream after all!"},
