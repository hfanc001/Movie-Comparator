"longDescription":"During the confusing and conspiratorial Joseon Dynasty King Gwanghae orders his councilor, Heo Kyun, to find him a double in order to avoid the constant threat of assassination. Heo Kyun finds Ha-sun, a jester who looks remarkably like the king. Just as feared, Gwanghae is poisoned. Heo Kyun proposes Ha-sun to fill the role as the king until Gwanghae recovers fully and grooms Ha-sun to look every bit like the king. However, his chief opposition, Park, notices the sudden shift in the king’s behavior and starts to ask questions."}]
