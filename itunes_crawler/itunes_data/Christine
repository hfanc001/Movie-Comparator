"longDescription":"CHRISTINE is the story of a woman caught in the crosshairs of a spiraling personal life and career crisis.  Christine, always the smartest person in the room at her local Florida news station, feels like she is destined for bigger things and is relentless in her pursuit of an on-air position in a larger market.  As an aspiring newswoman with an eye for nuance and social justice, she finds herself constantly butting heads with her boss, who pushes for juicier stories that will drive up ratings. Plagued by self-doubt and a tumultuous home life, Christine’s diminishing hope begins to rise when an on-air co-worker initiates a friendship which ultimately becomes yet another unrequited love. Disillusioned as her world continues to close in on her, Christine takes a dark and surprising turn.  Based on true events, director Antonio Campos’ intimate and sensitive portrait of a woman on the brink is grounded by Rebecca Hall’s impeccable and transformative performance as Christine.  Rounding out the supporting cast are superlative performances by Michael C. Hall (“Dexter”), Tracy Letts (“Homeland,” Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright), Maria Dizzia (“Orange Is The New Black”), Timothy Simons (“Veep”) and J. Smith-Cameron (“Margaret”).", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"From the creators of Shrek comes DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls, a smart, funny and irreverent comedy about the search for happiness, and just how far some will go to get it. This hilarious film transports audiences to a colorful, wondrous world populated by the overly optimistic Trolls, who have a constant dance in their step and a song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have Trolls in their stomachs. After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy (Kendrick), the happiest Troll ever born, and the overly-cautious curmudgeonly Branch (Timberlake) set off on a journey to rescue her friends. Together, this mismatched duo embarks on a mission full of adventure and mishaps – trying to tolerate each other long enough to get the job done. Utilizing music to further the film's narrative, the Trolls soundtrack is produced by Justin Timberlake and features original songs by Justin Timberlake and Gwen Stefani, in addition to a number of classic hits from the ‘60s – ‘80s.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

Rob Marshall, the talented filmmaker behind the Academy Award®-winning musical “Chicago” and Disney’s “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” helms the film, which is based on the Tony®-winning original musical by James Lapine, who also penned the screenplay, and legendary composer Stephen Sondheim, who provides the music and lyrics.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, is a film that grabs life by the ball. Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called Average Joe’s. The facility’s clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is made up of a self-styled pirate, a scrawny nerd (Justin Long) who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader, an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports, a dim-witted young man, and a cocky know-it-all who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter’s humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe’s, and Peter’s non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe’s to finalize Globo’s takeover of the gym. Peter’s boyish charm wins her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds."},
