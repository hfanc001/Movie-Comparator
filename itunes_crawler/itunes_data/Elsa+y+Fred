"longDescription":"The original adventure of a boy and his dog is considered by many as the best. Young Roddy McDowall (\"The Planet of the Apes,\" \"The Poseidon Adventure\") stars as a boy whose poor family is forced to sell their beloved collie, Lassie. After he's reluctantly taken away, the loyal dog embarks on a treacherous cross-country adventure to be reunited with McDowall. With Oscar-winners Elizabeth Taylor (\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,\" \"National Velvet\"), Donald Crisp (\"How Green Was My Valley\") and Edmund Gwenn (\"Miracle on 34th Street\") and Oscar-nominee Dame May Whitty (\"Gaslight,\" \"Mrs. Miniver\"). This is the original Oscar-nominated movie that launched two sequels and a popular TV series. Inducted into the Library of Congress National Film Registry and AFI recently selected Lassie as one of the 50 Greatest Heroes of all time."},
