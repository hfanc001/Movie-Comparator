"longDescription":"From award-winning playwright Alan Bennett (The Madness of King George) comes this delightfully witty comedy of eight boisterous-yet-talented schoolboys hoping to gain admittance to England's most prestigious universities.  They're aided on their quest by two teachers, a shrewd young upstart and an inspiring old eccentric, whose opposing philosophies challenge the boys to confront the true meaning of education and the relative values of happiness and success. Adapted from the original Tony Award winning play and starring the original Tony Award winning cast, \"The History Boys\" is an engaging, thought-provoking, and wickedly funny look at history, the pursuit of knowledge, and the utter randomness of life."},

"description":"<b>The #1 <i>New York Times<\/i>–bestselling story about American Olympic triumph in Nazi Germany, the inspiration for the PBS documentary <i>The Boys of '36<\/i>, broadcast to coincide with the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 80th anniversary of the boys' gold medal race. <\/b> <br /><br />Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936. <br /><br />The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together - a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism. <br /><br />Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, <i>The Boys in the Boat<\/i> is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times - the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's <i>The Amateurs<\/i>."},

"description":"This is how wars are fought now by children, hopped up on drugs, and wielding AK-47s. In the more than 50 violent conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But it is rare to find a first-person account from someone who endured this hell and survived. In <i>A Long Way Gone,<\/i> Beah, now 26 years old, tells a riveting story in his own words: how, at the age of 12, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By 13, he’d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts. This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty."},

"description":"When the 160 men of Charlie Company were drafted by the US Army in May 1966, they were part of the wave of conscription that would swell the American military to eighty thousand combat troops in Vietnam by the height of the war in 1968. In the spring of 1966 the war was still popular, and the draftees of Charlie Company saw their service as a rite of passage. But by December 1967, when the company returned home, only thirty men were not casualties - and they were among the first veterans of the war to be spit on and harassed by war protesters as they arrived back home. <br /><br />In <i>The Boys of '67<\/i>, Andrew Wiest, the award-winning author of <i>Vietnam's Forgotten Army<\/i> and <i>The Vietnam War 1956-1975<\/i>, examines the experiences of a company from the only division in the Vietnam era to train and deploy together in similar fashion to World War II's famous 101st Airborne Division. <br /><br />Wiest interviewed more than fifty officers and enlisted men who served with Charlie Company, including the surviving platoon leaders and both of the company's commanders. In addition, he interviewed fifteen family members of Charlie Company veterans, including wives, children, parents, and siblings. Wiest also had access to personal papers, collections of letters, a diary, an abundance of newspaper clippings, training notebooks, field manuals,condolence letters, and photographs from before, during, and after the conflict. <br /><br />As Wiest shows, the fighting that Charlie Company saw in1967 was nearly as bloody as many of the better publicized battles, including the infamous battles of the Ia Drang Valley and Hamburger Hill. As a result, many of the surviving members of Charlie Company came home with what the military now recognizes as post-traumatic stress disorder - a diagnosis that was not recognized until the late 1970s and was not widely treated until the 1980s. <br /><br />Only recently, after more than forty years, have many members of Charlie Company achieved any real a..."},

"description":"This is the dramatic story of the American bomber boys in World War II who brought the war to Hitler’s doorstep. With the narrative power of fiction, this is a harrowing ride through the fire-filled skies over Berlin, Hanover, and Dresden. <br /><br />Fighting at 25,000 feet in thin, freezing air no warriors had encountered before, bomber crews battled new kinds of assaults on body and mind. Air combat was deadly but intermittent: periods of inactivity and anxiety were followed by short bursts of fire and fear. Unlike infantrymen, bomber boys slept on clean sheets, drank beer in local pubs, and danced to the music of Glenn Miller’s Air Force Band. But they had a much greater chance of dying than ground soldiers. In 1943 an American bomber crewman stood only a one-in-five chance of surviving his tour of duty. The Eighth Air Force lost more men in the war than the US Marine Corps. <br /><br />The bomber crews were an elite group of warriors. Actor Jimmy Stewart was a bomber boy, as was “King of Hollywood” Clark Gable. The air war was filmed by Oscar-winning director William Wyler and covered by reporters like Andy Rooney and Walter Cronkite, all of whom flew combat missions with the men. The Anglo-American bombing campaign against Nazi Germany was the longest military campaign of World War II, a war within a war. Until Allied soldiers crossed into Germany in the final months of the war, it was the only battle fought inside the German homeland. <br /><br />Strategic bombing did not win the war, but the war could not have been won without it.

"description":"In the tradition of&#xa0;<i>Band of Brothers,<\/i> acclaimed combat historian Patrick K. O'Donnell cinematically tells one of World War II's greatest untold stories. <br /><br />It is said that the right man in the right place at the right time can mean the difference between victory and defeat. This is the dramatic story of 68 soldiers in the US Army's Second Ranger Battalion, Company D - \"Dog Company\" - who made that difference, time and again.&#xa0;From D-day, when German guns atop Pointe du Hoc threatened the Allied landings and the men of Dog Company scaled the sheer 90-foot cliffs to destroy them; to the slopes of Hill 400, in Germany's Hürtgen Forest, where the Rangers launched a desperate bayonet charge across an open field; to a \"quiet\" section of the Ardennes, where Dog Company suddenly found itself on the tip of the spear at the Battle of the Bulge; the men of Dog Company made the difference. <br /><br />America had many heroes in World War II; however, few can say that, but for them, the course of the war would have been very different. The right men, the right place, the right time - Dog Company. <br /><br />Patrick K. O'Donnell is the award-winning author of eight books, including the highly acclaimed account of the Battle of Fallujah <i>We Were One.<\/i> He has provided historical consulting for <i>Band of Brothers<\/i> and multiple documentaries. He lives in Austin, Texas."},

Twenty-two-year-old George McGovern who was to become a United States senator and a presidential candidate, flew thirty-five combat missions (all the Army would allow) and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. We meet him and his mates, his co-pilot killed in action, and crews of other planes -- many of whom did not come back.<br /><br />As <i>Band of Brothers<\/i> and <i>Citizen Soldiers<\/i> portrayed the bravery and ultimate victory of the American soldier from Normandy on to Germany, <i>The Wild Blue<\/i> makes clear the contribution these young men of the Army Air Forces stationed in Italy made to the Allied victory."},

"description":"<b>Audie Award Winner, History, 2014<\/b><br /><br /><b>Pulitzer Prize, General Nonfiction, 2013<\/b><br /><br />Arguably the most important American lawyer of the 20th century, Thurgood Marshall was on the verge of bringing the landmark suit <i>Brown v. Board of Education<\/i> before the U.S. Supreme Court when he became embroiled in an explosive and deadly case that threatened to change the course of the civil rights movement and cost him his life. <br /><br />In 1949, Florida's orange industry was booming, and citrus barons got rich on the backs of cheap Jim Crow labor. To maintain order and profits, they turned to Willis V. McCall, a violent sheriff who ruled Lake County with murderous resolve. When a white 17-year-old Groveland girl cried rape, McCall was fast on the trail of four young blacks who dared to envision a future for themselves beyond the citrus groves. By day's end, the Ku Klux Klan had rolled into town, burning the homes of blacks to the ground and chasing hundreds into the swamps, hell-bent on lynching the young men who came to be known as the \"Groveland Boys\". <br /><br />And so began the chain of events that would bring Thurgood Marshall, the man known as \"Mr. Civil Rights\", into the deadly fray. Associates thought it was suicidal for him to wade into the \"Florida Terror\" at a time when he was irreplaceable to the burgeoning civil rights movement, but the lawyer would not shrink from the fight - not after the Klan had murdered one of Marshall's NAACP associates involved with the case and Marshall had endured continual threats that he would be next. <br /><br />Drawing on a wealth of never-before-published material, including the FBI's unredacted Groveland case files, as well as unprecedented access to the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund files, King shines new light on this remarkable civil rights crusader, setting his rich and driving narrative against the heroic backdrop of a case that U.S. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson decried as \"one of the best examples of one of the worst menaces to American justice.\""},

"description":"Leon Leyson (born Leib Lezjon) was only 10 years old when the Nazis invaded Poland and his family was forced to relocate to the Krakow ghetto. With incredible luck, perseverance and grit, Leyson was able to survive the sadism of the Nazis, including that of the demonic Amon Goeth, commandant of Plaszow, the concentration camp outside Krakow. Ultimately, it was the generosity and cunning of one man, a man named Oskar Schindler, who saved Leon Leyson's life, and the lives of his mother, his father, and two of his four siblings, by adding their names to his list of workers in his factory - a list that became world renowned: Schindler's List. <br /><br />This, the only memoir published by a former Schindler's List child, perfectly captures the innocence of a small boy who goes through the unthinkable.

"description":"The classic story of life in apartheid South Africa. <br /><br />Mark Mathabane was weaned on devastating poverty and schooled in the cruel streets of South Africa's most desperate ghetto, where bloody gang wars and midnight police raids were his rites of passage. Like every other child born in the hopelessness of apartheid, he learned to measure his life in days, not years. Yet Mark Mathabane, armed only with the courage of his family and a hard-won education, raised himself up from the squalor and humiliation to win a scholarship to an American university. <br /><br />This extraordinary memoir of life under apartheid is a triumph of the human spirit over hatred and unspeakable degradation, for Mark Mathabane did what no physically and psychologically battered \"Kaffir\" from the rat-infested alleys of Alexandra was supposed to do - he escaped to tell about it. <br /><br />Mark Mathabane was born and raised in the ghetto of Alexandra in South Africa. He is the author of <i>Kaffir Boy<\/i>, <i>Kaffir Boy in America<\/i>, <i>Love in Black and White<\/i>, <i>African Women: Three Generations<\/i>, <i>Miriam's Song<\/i>, and <i>The Proud Liberal<\/i>.

The U.S. media call them \"security contractors.\" They call themselves \"mercs,\" and they operate under their own rules.<br /><i>Washington Post<\/i> reporter Steve Fainaru traveled with several groups of security contractors to find out what motivates them to put their lives in danger every day. What emerges is a searing, revealing, and sometimes darkly funny look at the men who live and work in the battlefields of Iraq: some are desperate, some are confused, and some are just out for a lark. Some disappear into the void that is Iraq and are never seen again. It's not a pretty picture that Fainaru reveals, but it is brutally real and shockingly honest. <br /><br /><i>Big Boy Rules<\/i> is an unforgettable leap into the mayhem of Iraq and into the dark recesses of the minds of American policymakers and the warriors they hire."},

"description":"The very young men who flew the B24s over Germany in World War II against terrible odds were an exemplary band of brothers. In <i>The Wild Blue<\/i>, Stephen Ambrose recounts their extraordinary brand of heroism, skill, daring, and comradeship. <br /><br />Ambrose describes how the Army Air Forces recruited, trained, and chose those few who would undertake the most demanding and dangerous jobs in the war. These are the boys - turned pilots, bombardiers, navigators, and gunners of the B24s - who suffered over 50 percent casualties. <br /><br />Ambrose carries us along in the crowded, uncomfortable, and dangerous B24s as their crews fought to the death through thick, black, deadly flak to reach their targets and destroy the German war machine or else went down in flames. Twenty-two-year-old George McGovern, who was to become a United States senator and a presidential candidate, flew 35 combat missions (all the Army would allow) and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. We meet him and his mates, his co-pilot killed in action, and crews of other planes - many of whom did not come back. <br /><br />As <i>Band of Brothers<\/i> and <i>Citizen Soldiers<\/i> portrayed the bravery and ultimate victory of the American soldier from Normandy on to Germany, <i>The Wild Blue<\/i> makes clear the contribution these young men of the Army Air Forces stationed in Italy made to the Allied victory."},

"description":"From America's preeminent military historian, Stephen E. Ambrose, comes a brilliant telling of the war in Europe, from D-Day, June 6, 1944, to the end; 11 months later, on May 7, 1945. To create this astonishing narrative, Ambrose draws from his 5 acclaimed works about that conflict, particularly from the definitive and comprehensive <i>D-Day<\/i> and <i>Citizen Soldiers<\/i>. As always, it is the ordinary boys and men who command Ambrose's attention and awe. <i>The Victors<\/i> tells their collective story of how citizens became soldiers in the best army in the world. Ambrose draws on thousands of interviews and oral histories, from the high command - Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton - on down through officers and enlisted men, to recreate the last year of the Second World War when the Allied soldiers pushed the Germans out of France, chased them across Germany, and destroyed the Nazi regime."},

"description":"In <i>Public Enemies<\/i>, Bryan Burrough strips away a thick layer of myths put out by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI to tell the full story of the most spectacular crime wave in American history, the two-year battle between the young Hoover and an assortment of criminals who became national icons: John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barkers.<br /> In 1933, police jurisdictions ended at state lines, the FBI was in its infancy, and fast cars and machine guns were easily available. It was a great time to be a bank robber. On hand were a motley crew of criminal masterminds, sociopaths, romantics, and cretins.<br /><br /> Bryan Burrough has unearthed an extraordinary amount of new material on all the major figures involved, revealing many fascinating interconnections in the vast underworld ecosystem that stretched from Texas up to Minnesota.<br /><br /> But the real-life connections were insignificant next to the sense of connectedness J. Edgar Hoover worked to create in the mind of the American public, using the \"Great Crime Wave\" to gain the position of untouchable power he would occupy for almost half a century."},
