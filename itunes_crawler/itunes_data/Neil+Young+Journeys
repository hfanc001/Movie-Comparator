"longDescription":"In May of 2011, Neil Young drove a 1956 Crown Victoria from his idyllic hometown of Omemee, Ontario to downtown Toronto's iconic Massey Hall where he intimately performed the last two nights of his solo world tour. Along the drive, Young recounted insightful and introspective stories from his youth to filmmaker Jonathan Demme. Demme, a long-time fan and collaborator, captured these tales of Young's childhood and masterfully weaved them together with his mesmerizing music including live performances from the 2010 album Le Noise and powerful renditions of classics including \"Ohio\", â€œHey Hey, My My\", \"I Believe in You\" and previously unreleased songs \"Leia\" and \"You Never Call.\" Through the tunes and the tales, Demme portrays a personal, retrospective look into the heart and soul of the artist."},

"description":"As his parentsÂ¿ shouting tears through the walls to the room where he is supposed to be sleeping, young Neil Waldman buries his face in his pillow and tries to swallow his tears. The trauma of his parentsÂ¿ fighting rips at him, but it will also open the path to NeilÂ¿s career as an artist. Seeking refuge from a turbulent home life, Neil and his three siblings turn to the world of creativity. Their motherÂ¿s book from an art museum in Russia is all the children need to set fire to their imaginations. And from there, drawing and painting become much more than pleasurable diversions - they become lifelines of hope that allow the youths to believe that there is lasting beauty in the world. <br /><br />Recipient of the ALA Notable and ParentsÂ¿ Choice Awards, Waldman has written and illustrated more than 50 books for children. Narrator George Guidall delivers a powerful performance of the authorÂ¿s engaging memoir."}]
