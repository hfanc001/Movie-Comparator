"description":"In this hour, everyone loves the movies, for a laugh or just to escape normal life for a few minutes. Sometimes a film can do more, pushing the limits of technology or of ideas. And sometimes films just push the limits of good taste. John Waters has done it with films like <i>Pink Flamingos<\/i> and <i>Polyester<\/i>. His new project is not a film at all, but a book about his <i>Role Models<\/i>. Steve Paulson expected the lesbian stripper Lady Zorro from Waters, but was surprised by the singer Johnny Mathis.<br /><br />Next, the dark heart of Hollywood has resulted in films like <i>Psycho , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre<\/i>, and <i>Silence of the Lambs<\/i>, all of them inspired by the mass murdered Ed Gein. No one expected the latest such inspiration: <i>Ed Gein: The Musical<\/i>. Steve Paulson talks with Dan Davies, who wrote the film and plays the title role. <br /><br />And then there's the YouTube sensation <i>The Winnebago Man<\/i>, also known as \"the angriest man in the world.\" It captured the imagination of a young filmmaker named Ben Steinbauer, who tracked down the angry man, Jack Rebney, now 81 years old. Anne Strainchamps spoke with them both.<br /><br />Finally, Tasha Robinson is an associate editor of <i>The Onion's<\/i> AV Club, who says 2010 was the year of the documentary that wasn't. The two sensations of the year, <i>Catfish<\/i> and <i>Exit Through the Giftshop<\/i>, may not even have been real documentaries. But she says no matter what, 2010 was a great year. <i>Goldilocks<\/i> might once have not even been considered a film. After all, it's shot entirely on an iPhone 4 and distributed not through theaters but via an app. The filmmakers Michael Keorbel and Anna Elizabeth James tell Jim Fleming where they got the idea for this compelling, definitely low-budget, film. [Broadcast Date: April 6, 2012]"}]
