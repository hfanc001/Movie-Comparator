"longDescription":"Hit the highway on a road trip like no other in this hilariously heartwarming Duplass Brothers film. Romantically challenged New York indie-rocker Josh (Mark Duplass) can't figure out why his career and love life seem to be spinning out of control. Hoping some time on the road will clear things up; he plans a trip to visit his father with a very unusual gift. But the journey home takes on some unexpected emotional baggage when his commitment-obsessed girlfriend, Emily (Kathryn Aselton), and slacker brother, Rhett (Rhett Wilkins), decide to come along. Honest, endearing, and laugh-out-loud funny, The Puffy Chair is a wildly unpredictable and charming comedy."}]
