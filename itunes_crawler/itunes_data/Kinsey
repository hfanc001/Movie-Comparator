"longDescription":"Kinsey is a portrait of researcher Alfred Kinsey, driven to uncover the most private secrets of a nation. What begins for Kinsey as a scientific endeavor soon takes on an intensely personal relevance, ultimately becoming an unexpected journey into the mystery of human behavior. Liam Neeson stars as Kinsey, who in 1948 irrevocably changed American culture with his book Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Interviewing thousands of people about the most intimate aspects of their lives, Kinsey lifted the weight of secrecy and shame from a society in which sexual practices were mostly hidden. His work sparked one of the most intense cultural debates of the past century, a debate that rages on today. Using the technique of his own famous sex interviews, Kinsey recounts the scientistâ€™s extraordinary journey from obscurity to global fame."},

To have a shot at doing that, though, they need to get invited to the class bullyâ€™s house-party that nightâ€¦and, sadly for them, they aren't. The two friends hatch an elaborate and desperate bid to get in, which takes them on an unexpected adventure, navigating a minefield of problems from gun-wielding gangsters to deviant drug lords. The boys must work together to fulfill their fantasies in time to catch their flights home.\r\n\r\nWith an all-star cast, including Josh Leyva, Bobby Lee, Madison Iseman, and Deji Olatunji, this is an outrageous and hilarious story of two boysâ€¦becoming men.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

The cops suspected homicide, but they could find neither motive nor suspect.

"description":"Calling <i>T is for Trespass<\/i> \"taut, terrifying, transfixing and terrific\", <i>USA Today<\/i> went on to ask, \"What does it take to write 20 novels about the same character and manage to create a fresh, genre-bending novel every time?\"<br />It's a question worth pondering. Through 20 excursions into the dark side of the human soul, Sue Grafton has never written the same book twice. And so it is with this, her 21st. Once again, she breaks genre formulas, giving us a twisting, complex, surprise-filled, and totally satisfying thriller.<br /><br />It's April 1988, a month before Kinsey Millhone's 38th birthday, and she's alone in her office doing paperwork when a young man arrives unannounced. He has a preppy air about him and looks as if he'd be carded if he tried to buy booze, but Michael Sutton is 27, an unemployed college dropout. Twenty-one years earlier, a four-year-old girl disappeared. A recent reference to her kidnapping has triggered a flood of memories. Sutton now believes he stumbled on her lonely burial when he was six years old. He wants Kinsey's help in locating the child's remains and finding the men who killed her. It's a long shot, but he's willing to pay cash up front, and Kinsey agrees to give him one day.<br /><br />As her investigation unfolds, she discovers Michael Sutton has an uneasy relationship with the truth. In essence, he's the boy who cried wolf. Is his current story true, or simply one more in a long line of fabrications?<br /><br />Grafton moves the narrative between the 80s and the 60s, changing points of view, building multiple subplots, and creating memorable characters. Gradually, we see how they all connect. But at the beating center of the novel is Kinsey Millhone, sharp-tongued, observant, a loner - \"a heroine\", said <i>The New York Times Book Review<\/i>, \"with foibles you can laugh at and faults you can forgive.\""},

For the record, I'd like to say I'm a big fan of forgiveness as long as I'm given the opportunity to get even first.\" <br /><br />A woman with a murky past who kills herself-or was it murder? A dying old man cared for by the son he pummeled mercilessly. A lovely woman whose life is about to splinter into a thousand fragments. A professional shoplifting ring racking up millions in stolen goods. A brutal and unscrupulous gangster. A wandering husband, rich and powerful. A spoiled kid awash in gambling debt thinking he can beat the system. A lonely widower mourning the death of his lover, desperate for answers that may be worse than the pain of his loss. An elegant but ruthless businessman whose dealings are definitely outside the law: the spider at the center of the web. <br /><br />And Kinsey Millhone, whose thirty-eighth-birthday gift is a punch in the face that leaves her with two black eyes and a busted nose. <br /><br />V: Victim.

"description":"<b>Of the #1 <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling Kinsey Millhone series, NPR said, \"Makes me wish there were more than 26 letters.\" <\/b><br /><br /><i>Two dead bodies changed the course of my life that fall. One of them I knew and the other I'd never laid eyes on until I saw him in the morgue.<\/i> <br /><br />The first was a local PI of suspect reputation. He'd been gunned down near the beach at Santa Teresa. It looked like a robbery gone bad. The other was on the beach six weeks later. He'd been sleeping rough. Probably homeless. No identification. A slip of paper with Millhone's name and number was in his pants pocket. The coroner asked her to come to the morgue to see if she could ID him. <br /><br />Two seemingly unrelated deaths, one a murder, the other apparently of natural causes. <br /><br />But as Kinsey digs deeper into the mystery of the John Doe, some very strange linkages begin to emerge. And before long at least one aspect is solved as Kinsey literally finds the key to his identity. \"And just like that,\" she says, \"the lid to Pandora's box flew open. It would take me another day before I understood how many imps had been freed, but for the moment, I was inordinately pleased with myself.\" <br /><br />In this multilayered tale, the surfaces seem clear, but the underpinnings are full of betrayals, misunderstandings, and outright murderous fraud. And Kinsey, through no fault of her own, is thoroughly compromised. <br /><br />W is forâ€¦wandererâ€¦worthlessâ€¦wrongedâ€¦. <br /><br /><i>W is for wasted.<\/i>"},

Lance Grayden, a veteran coach who left the league years ago when his daughter moved to an elite softball club team, and then college, has returned to \"give something back\" to the community. Assuming he'd be coaching a 16-and-under team of seasoned and accomplished competitors, he is instead saddled with a 10-and-under team of inexperienced players. Not only is he forced to go back to the basics and teach the fundamentals of the game to the little girls, half of whom would rather be in the dugout eating snacks, but he also faces the greater challenge of riding herd over their over-eager, overly ambitious, and entirely delusional parents whose ridiculous behavior is more suited to five-year-olds than adults."},

"description":"Of number-one <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Sue Grafton, NPR's Maureen Corrigan said, \"Makes me wish there were more than 26 letters.\" With only two letters left, Grafton's many devoted listeners will share that sentiment. <br /><br />X: the number 10. An unknown quantity. A mistake. A cross. A kiss. <br /><br />X: the shortest entry in <i>Webster's Unabridged<\/i>. Derived from Greek and Latin and commonly found in science, medicine, and religion. The most graphically dramatic letter. Notoriously tricky to pronounce: Think <i>xylophone<\/i>. <br /><br />X: the 24th letter in the English alphabet. <br /><br />Sue Grafton's <i>X<\/i>: Perhaps her darkest and most chilling novel, it features a remorseless serial killer who leaves no trace of his crimes. Once again breaking the rules and establishing new paths, Grafton wastes little time identifying this sociopath. The test is whether Kinsey can prove her case against him before she becomes his next victim."},
