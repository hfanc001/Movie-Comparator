"longDescription":"In the series premiere, a Pteranodon brings death to the skies over Vancouver's downtown, while a Utahraptor threatens visitors to the city's beloved Stanley Park. Visionary inventor Evan Cross and predator expert Dylan Weir discover that these creatures are coming to the present through magnetic anomalies, mysterious portals in time and space. And for Evan, it's not the first time one of these creatures has come into his life. A devastating encounter with an Albertosaurus six years ago set him on a mission to find the Anomalies, and protect the world from the creatures that come through them.Helped by his Special Projects Group (SPG) -- Toby Nance, Evan's resident technical wizard, Mac Rendell, a British ex-pat with a yen for adventure, and Tony Drake, Evan's friend in the Predator Control office -- Evan and Dylan get more than they bargained for when they join forces to investigate the Anomalies and the creature attacks. And a mysterious visit from Connar Temple (from the original UK version of Primeval) leaves Evan with more questions than answers. Angelika Finch, Evan's oldest friend and the no-nonsense CFO of his company, Cross Photonics, tries to convince Evan to leave the dinosaur problem to the authorities -- even going so far as to track down lieutenant Ken Leeds at Project Magnet, the government bureau charged with handling the unexplained. When a missing child draws our team back to Stanley Park, it's a race against time to find him -- without betraying their secrets."},

"shortDescription":"Connor unveils the new anomaly detector, but the team is caught off-guard when a saber-toothed cat is seen roaming around a theme park. When a man snaps a few pictures of the beast and uploads them to the internet, Jenny must deal with the media fall-out.", 
"longDescription":"A cocky young paint-baller in a holiday adventure park is being stalked through the undergrowth. His screams echo through the wilderness as he is torn to shreds by a terrifying creature (of which we see only glimpses). Cutter and Connor unveil the new anomaly detector. Everything appears to be in working order, but the machine apparently fails at the first time of asking when reports come in of the new creature attack. Lester is furious, but Cutter is convinced there is nothing wrong with the machine. Cutter and the team arrive at the adventure park. Valerie, the nervous deputy manager, agrees that the park should be evacuated, but Jenny is having none of it – this will be the surest way of drawing more attention from the press – and she is backed up by Lester. Reluctantly, the team has to accept that the holiday park will not be evacuated. Cutter comes to believe that the attack, although horrible, could be relatively conventional. The animal to blame could be a rogue big cat. As the team goes in search of the animal, Connor is left to look after the safety of the holiday-makers. He disgraces himself when he shoots the furry park mascot, thinking it is a real beast. Unbeknown to him, the real menace is lurking very nearby. On his way home, the unfortunate mascot is attacked and ripped apart at a railway station. Stephen, who is with Valerie, hears the attack and rushes to investigate. He sees the huge animal but is forced to let it flee, as he looks after the terrified Valerie. He is convinced it is too big to be any surviving species of big cat; it must be a creature from an anomaly. But with no firm evidence and no clear sighting, the team is baffled. To Jenny’s horror, a train-spotter has caught the attack on camera and has uploaded pictures to the internet. While she deals with the media fall-out, Cutter is more concerned by what he finds on the pictures. The creature is a Smilodon, or saber-tooth cat. There can be no doubt, this is an ancient creature. But why did the anomaly detector fail to work? While Cutter and the team prepare traps for the creature, they find a mutilated body buried in a shallow grave. The man was clearly mauled by the Smilodon and, equally clearly, there must have been human intervention to bury him. Before Cutter can work out the implications of this, the cat attacks them, drawn by the scent of the fresh meat they have put out as bait. Cutter is forced to take refuge on an adventure walkway slung between the trees, only to find the gigantic cat following him. Left clinging by his fingertips, he finally manages to cut the rope bridge and send the cat tumbling to the ground, but it rights itself and lands gracefully before escaping. Cutter now realizes the answer to at least one riddle: the cat must have come through as a cub and the anomaly has long since disappeared.

By the time the gang congregates at headquarters, however, the detector has crashed and they have no idea where the anomaly has formed, nor where Leek is. As Cutter waits impatiently for Connor to fix the machine, Leek is at the site instructing armed mercenaries to carry out some kind of secret mission. The men pass through the anomaly and see Taylor waving frantically at them. They ignore her – but Taylor isn’t asking for help, she’s trying to warn them."},

"longDescription":"When an exhibition of ancient Egyptian relics comes to London's British Museum, an anomaly opens in a mysterious monument called the Sun Cage. A creature emerges from it - a Pristichampsus, a kind of monstrous crocodile that can run on two legs. This creature, which comes from a past much more distant than the Egypt of the Pharaohs, somehow became worshipped as a God in that civilization, and is now portrayed in the hieroglyphics on the Sun Cage. \r\nThe murderous creature wreaks havoc in the museum before escaping into the city. Helped by Sarah Page, the smart and surprisingly sexy archaeologist at the museum, Cutter and the team (Abby, Connor and their new Head of Security, Captain Becker) track it down and eventually defeat it - though not before Connor begins to believe in a legendary curse attached to the monument (in the style of Tutankhamun). He convinces himself he is next in line for the crocodile God's revenge. \r\nAt the climax of the story, the Pristichampsus is safely deposited back into the past, where it retains its place in Egyptian mythology, but the anomaly turns out to be somehow permanently contained within the Sun Cage, so when the exhibition moves on to another city, the curse continues. \r\nAt the end of the episode, Cutter asks Sarah to join the team and research mythical beasts that could, in fact, be creatures out of time and place."},

"shortDescription":"When Cutter meets Jenny Lewis, he can’t help but notice that she is sharp, cynical and a perfect replica of the recently vanished Claudia Brown. She joins the team in fighting a horde of giant carnivorous worms that have overtaken a nearby skyscraper.", 
"longDescription":"Cutter and the team are joined by a new PR guru, in the guise of Jenny Lewis. Sharp, cynical and witty, she almost immediately develops a sparky and adversarial relationship with Cutter. The fact that she looks every inch like Claudia Brown but has no recollection of her doppelganger, adds even more intrigue. Meanwhile, Connor is picked up in a video store by a beautiful young woman called Caroline. Poised, well-connected and effortlessly sexy, Caroline is everything Connor is not, and her interest in him is all the more surprising for it. But Connor isn’t waiting around to analyze his good fortune. Right from the beginning Abby takes against Caroline, for reasons even she herself doesn’t quite understand. But meanwhile, a gleaming new skyscraper in the center of the city has quickly developed a reputation for teething problems in its electronics, so no one is surprised when smoke is spotted creeping out from the server room. On inspection, the janitor finds a thick layer of mist hugging the floor and a foul sulfurous smell – but no fire. Then something moves in the mist and he is suddenly yanked out of sight by a shadowy creature. The mist continues to spread... Cutter and Connor get down to the serious work of trying to build an anomaly detector system. For the first time since the crisis began the team will no longer be dependent on luck to find the anomalies. Lester is skeptical of the plan but Leek is enthusiastic and Lester reluctantly agrees on a budget. Connor is immediately set to work. At the skyscraper panicking staff flee as the sinister mist oozes down the stairs and lift wells, accompanied by a foul stench of rotting matter. A fire crew arrives and enters a surreal office waist high in sulfurous fog. They are attacked by shadowy, giant creatures; we see tantalizing glimpses of these odd, frightening beasts that seem to live inside the mist. The skyscraper is evacuated but in one glass-walled meeting room a group of executives assumes the warning alarm is nothing more than a drill. They cannot yet see the mist enveloping them...By the time the team arrive the skyscraper is filling with fog. While they explore offices full of abandoned chairs and desks they discover that there are giant carnivorous worms moving inside it. Leaping from desk to desk they only just manage to escape with their lives, while a fireman is killed horribly. Jenny, who has been appointed as operations manager on the ground (reporting directly to Leek and Lester) is given her first taste of her new job and nearly breaks down with horror when she realizes what she is dealing with. But she recovers, showing real guts in the process and Cutter cannot help being impressed, even though the two of them find themselves in almost constant opposition. The race is on to rescue the executives in the meeting room before the worms get to them first. In the process Stephen gets separated and gets trapped in a lift shaft. Cutter realizes the worms can’t survive outside the fog and Connor and Abby set about turning up the heating in the building. They succeed in doing this but no one is prepared for the effect the heat has on these deadly creatures."},

"shortDescription":"There are new creatures stalking the underground drains, but this time they come from the future.  After one of them snatches Abby, the team frantically searches for her, but can Cutter outsmart these highly evolved sharks before it’s too late?", 
"longDescription":"When a disco boat hosting a fancy dress party comes under attack from a killer shark, Cutter and the team realize they have a new underwater incursion. But a grisly discovery during the post-mortem suggests the creature may not have come from the past. The creature’s secret weapon is a ferocious, giant proboscis that shoots from its jaws to trap its prey. Cutter has never seen anything like it and is convinced they are dealing with a species from the future. On the other side of the city, a group of teenagers is playing basketball near a flooded drain. When one of the boys wanders too close, something snatches and drags him below ground. Cutter arrives and discovers the flooded drain leads directly to the canal where the disco boat was moored. It looks like a second shark may be at large and has swum up the drain. Cutter and the team pursue the creature back towards the canal only for it to disappear without trace. With no sign of any anomaly, Cutter is at a loss to explain where the creature has gone. Cutter starts to wonder if they could be looking for a second, entirely different creature. Perhaps something that could even move comfortably out of the water and onto dry land. He realizes he could be searching not for a sea creature but some kind of mammal. Cutter wants to widen the search but is over-ruled by Lester. Stephen annoys Cutter by siding with Lester. Cutter is left bristling with frustration. Cutter decides to go it alone and searches the site of the original attack – the disco boat. He hears some kind of strange, deeply affecting whale song coming through the hull of the boat. Someone or something is calling to him. He drags Abby and Connor along to investigate but disaster strikes when they try playing the whale song back underwater to lure the creature – Abby is brutally snatched and disappears. Cutter and the team fear she must surely be dead. The whole team is devastated, but the terrible news hits Connor hardest of all. Cutter retreats from the investigation, overcome with guilt. But Claudia visits him later that night and says the team needs his help. She believes he has the key to finding the creature responsible. Stephen continues the underwater search at the canal, employing a remote-controlled submarine to help search the canal. But it is Claudia who makes the breakthrough when she investigates the flooded basement of a nearby building. Could this be where the creature is hiding out? Abby is alive, being kept prisoner underground along with the boy from the basketball pitch. When she makes a bid to escape she comes face to face with her captors – a weird future mermaid creature – part humanoid, part walrus. Cutter searches the flooded building with Claudia, joined by the distraught and angry Connor, who blames Cutter for Abby’s death. Meanwhile, Stephen’s remote controlled submarine detects an underwater passage. Could this be the creature’s secret escape route? Cutter and Connor break through into the underwater chamber where Abby and the basketball player are being held captive. But Abby is gone – the mermaid creatures have dragged her off. Cutter and Connor realize Abby is alive, but they come under attack. Cutter desperately fends the creatures off while Connor sets off to find Abby. While Cutter battles with the mermaid creatures the frantic Stephen realizes he needs to swim up the underwater passage and help Cutter before it is too late. Connor finally tracks Abby down but there is one final surprise – the creatures have brought Abby here as an offering to their Queen – a vast Jabba the Hut leviathan of ferocious strength. A battle to the death ensues, with Connor and Abby finally vanquishing the giant Mer-Queen. The team is left exhausted but happily reunited."},

Dylan is approached by Leo, a young cryptozoology enthusiast who's positive he's seen something remarkable in the water near his home. He believes the sea creature may be the inspiration for his people's legend of \"Sisiutl.\" Evan goes with Mac and Toby to investigate an Anomaly that pinged their Detector grid, and they wind up crossing paths with Dylan and Leo. The Anomaly is underwater, right offshore from First Nations land that is being controversially developed for an expanded oil tanker loading facility. There are protestors of the construction, among them Leo's uncle Raymond, who comes under suspicion from Detective Harlow for the deaths. Dylan is torn between helping with the investigation, and a chance to get her old job and her old life back if she agrees to stop making waves. When the \"sea serpent\" turns out to be a Titanboa, a giant snake that can leave the water and become a threat on land as well, Evan and Dylan work together to turn its course and send it back toward the Anomaly."},

"shortDescription":"Claudia’s existence has been completely erased- and Cutter is the only one who knows.  As he grapples with her sudden disappearance, a raptor runs loose in a shopping mall.  The team must get it back to the past before it kills again.", 
"longDescription":"Night at a local shopping mall. Something on a CCTV monitor grabs the attention of the security guards. They investigate, only to be attacked by a ferocious Jurassic-era Utahraptor. The anomalies are back…At the original anomaly site, as Cutter grapples with Claudia Brown’s disappearance, a new second-in-command has taken her place in the team – the oily Oliver Leek. Not only that, but the team now has a headquarters. A hi-tech, highly sophisticated operations base called the Anomaly Research Center, or ARC. No one believes Cutter when he tries to explain that the present has altered, resulting in Claudia’s disappearance. In fact, they think he has gone mad. But there is not time for idle chat, as the team gets a call reporting the creature incursion at the shopping mall. Once on site, the team members arm themselves with tranquilizer guns. Stephen tries to discuss his youthful affair with Helen, but Cutter is unwilling to confront the issue. A sense of unfinished business lingers between the two old friends. While the others investigate the anomaly behind the bowling alley, Connor heads for the confectionary, only to find a very hungry raptor lurking amongst the sweets and soft drinks. Despite a narrow escape, Cutter remains adamant that they should capture the raptors and put them back where they belong – alive. The team face another scare when they hear what they think is the creature coming back for them – only to find it is a cleaner who has been left behind when the mall was evacuated. Cutter and Stephen find the raptor in a laser games arcade. Stephen is at the creature’s mercy, and urges Cutter to shoot it with his dart gun – but the gun jams. Confused by the lights and noise the creature escapes, and Stephen demands to know why Cutter didn’t shoot it when he had the chance. He refuses to believe Cutter’s protestations that the gun failed to work. The deepening rift suspicion between them is worse than ever. As Abby and Connor escort the cleaner to safety, he is attacked by a baby raptor. Connor races to the rescue and accidentally shoots Abby with a tranquilizer gun. He finally manages to neutralize the baby raptor and then goes in search of Cutter, leaving the cleaner apparently dead. When they return, the cleaner has mysteriously vanished and Abby is out cold. Cutter thinks the raptors might be a family unit and he is right. They lure a third, and much bigger raptor to the bowling alley, but it escapes to the car park before they can capture it. Using trail bikes, Cutter and Stephen manage to coral it back inside and they eventually bring it down with tranquilizers. Now all they have to do is put it back in the Jurassic era….something Cutter insists he has to do alone. During their battle in the mall Cutter notices that all the radios seemed to be suffering from some kind of mysterious electronic interference and he suspects it is connected to the anomalies. He realizes they can now build a detector tuned to the same wave length to locate new anomalies. Charging Connor with the task there is a possibility that the team can now gain the upper ground. Back at the ARC, Lester is told by Leek that a new media relations manager (basically a super spin-doctor ) is to join the team. Lester is beginning to feel the pressure for results from above. While the rest of the team welcome the new addition, her arrival at the ARC sends Cutter into a tail spin. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to a girl he once knew, Nick Cutter’s new reality is about to get even weirder."},
