"longDescription":"An Official Selection of both the 2007 Toronto Film Festival and the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, My Kid Could Paint That released in home entertainment on March 4, 2008. Documenting the rise and fall of four-year old artist Marla Olmstead, Amir Bar-Lev's - a much-discussed documentary. According to her parents, Mark and Laura Olmstead, Marla began painting when she was only two. By the time she was four, her work had been exhibited at a gallery and she was profiled in The New York Times. But rumors that her father might be doing the paintings and crediting Marla led to a backlash against the family and, in order to clear their name, the Olmsteads invited filmmaker Amir Bar-Lev to document Marla's technique over the course of a year. The films' release was greeted by controversy, with the Olmstead family speaking out against the documentary on CNN, Nightline, and Good Morning America."},
