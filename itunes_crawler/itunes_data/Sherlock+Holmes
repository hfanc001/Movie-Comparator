"description":"From <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling author Laurie R. King comes the book that introduced us to the ingenious Mary Russell - Sherlock Holmes mysteries. <br /><br />In 1915, Sherlock Holmes is retired and quietly engaged in the study of honeybees when a young woman literally stumbles into him on the Sussex Downs. Fifteen years old, gawky, egotistical, and recently orphaned, the young Mary Russell displays an intellect to impress even Sherlock Holmes - and match him wit for wit. Under his reluctant tutelage, this very modern 20th-century woman proves a deft protégée and a fitting partner for the Victorian detective. <br /><br />In their first case together, they must track down a kidnapped American senator's daughter and confront a truly cunning adversary: a bomber who has set trip wires for the sleuths and who will stop at nothing to end their partnership. <br /><br />Full of brilliant deductions, disguises, and dangers, this first book of the Mary Russell - Sherlock Holmes mysteries is \"wonderfully original and entertaining...absorbing from beginning to end.\" (<i>Booklist<\/i>). Named \"One of the Century's Best 100 Mysteries\" by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association."},

"description":"In a strange room in Morocco, Mary Russell is trying to solve a pressing mystery: Who am I? She has awakened with shadows in her mind, blood on her hands, and soldiers pounding on the door. Out in the hivelike streets, she discovers herself strangely adept in the skills of the underworld, escaping through alleys and rooftops, picking pockets and locks. She is clothed like a man, and armed only with her wits and a scrap of paper containing a mysterious Arabic phrase. Overhead, warplanes pass ominously north. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Holmes is pulled by two old friends and a distant relation into the growing war between France, Spain, and the Rif Revolt led by Emir Abd el-Krim - who may be a Robin Hood or a power mad tribesman. The shadows of war are drawing over the ancient city of Fez, and Holmes badly wants the wisdom and courage of his wife, whom he's learned, to his horror, has gone missing. As Holmes searches for her, and Russell searches for herself, each tries to crack deadly parallel puzzles before it's too late for them, for Africa, and for the peace of Europe."},

Independent at last, with a passion for divinity and detective work, her most baffling mystery may now involve Holmes and the burgeoning of a deeper affection between herself and the retired detective. Russell's attentions turn to the New Temple of God and its leader, Margery Childe, a charismatic suffragette and a mystic, whose draw on the young theology scholar is irresistible. But when four bluestockings from the Temple turn up dead shortly after changing their wills, could sins of a capital nature be afoot? Holmes and Russell investigate, as their partnership takes a surprising turn."},

Mary Russell Holmes and her husband, the retired Sherlock Holmes, are enjoying the summer together on their Sussex estate when they are visited by an old friend, Miss Dorothy Ruskin, an archeologist just returned from Palestine. <br /><br />She leaves in their protection an ancient manuscript which seems to hint at the possibility that Mary Magdalene was an apostle - an artifact certain to stir up a storm of biblical proportions in the Christian establishment.

"description":"\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\" is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is the second of the 12 <i>Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<\/i> in most British editions of the canon and the second of the eight stories from <i>His Last Bow<\/i> in most American versions. When <i>Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<\/i> was published in the United States for the first time, the publishers believed \"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\" was too scandalous for the American public, since it dealt with adultery. As a result, this story was not published in the U.S. until many years later, when it was added to <i>His Last Bow<\/i>."},

"description":"Three Compelling Sherlock Holmes Mysteries In One Book. Narrated by the celebrity actor Simon Prebble who is also known as an award winner for the best voice in fiction. <br /><br /><b>Story One:<\/b> \"The case of the missing Mayan Codices\". <br /><br /><b>\"I do not suppose that you have brought your revolver with you Watson?\"<br />I shook my head to indicate that my response was in the negative to his question. He turned his head forward again and led us through the kitchen, past several side pantries. As we cautiously inched forward, Holmes observed that the blood trail consisted of droplets of varying size. \"Whomever it came from, they must have been applying intermittent pressure on the wound as they walked.\"<\/b> <br /><br /><b>Story Two:<\/b> \"Murders on the Voyage to India\". <br /><br /><b>Murder; \"Murder.\" The scream echoed down the hallway shaking me from my slumber and into the dim vision of the electric lights. Someone was banging on the door and Watson scrambled to open it. I was bleary- eyed, still feeling a bit desensitized when Evelyn Reed burst in to the door. Her hands were covered with odious red, and tears streaked across her reddened face. \"There's been a murder!\" She repeated. <\/b> <br /><br /><b>Story Three:<\/b> \"The Heist\". <br /><br /><b>\"Gentlemen, I am here to represent the interest of Henry Bank and Trust. We would like to resolve the situation quickly and quietly, so that all the investors can move forward with a minimum of anxiety.\" Holmes sat across from her, studying her with a nonplussed air. \"I must admit\" he said, \"that I do not know how to assist you. Inspector Lestrade was here earlier, and it appears that you are missing nothing and they have no thieves in custody. When the bank emptied today, everything was in place, except for the criminals.\"<\/b>"},
