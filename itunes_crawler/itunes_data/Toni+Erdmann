"longDescription":"Winfried doesn't see much of his daughter Ines and decides to surprise her with a visit. It's an awkward move because Ines has a responsible position as a corporate strategist in Bucharest. Winfried is a practical joker and his little jabs at his daughter's lifestyle make things even worse. Father and daughter reach an impasse, and Winfried agrees to return home to Germany. Enter flashy \"Toni Erdmann\" - Winfried's smooth-talking alter ego. Disguised in a tacky suit, weird wig and even weirder fake teeth, Toni barges into Ines' professional life, claiming to be her CEO's life coach. As Toni, Winfried is bolder and doesn't hold back, but Ines meets the challenge. The harder they push, the closer they become. In all the madness, Ines begins to understand that her eccentric father might deserve some place in her life after all."}]
