Everyone seems wary of approaching it, but when Quinn (Jerry O'Connell) reaches for it, a woman, Taryn Miller (Perrey Reeves), fires a dart at him, but misses. The Sliders run, evading Taryn. At a bar, they discover that in this world, crime is almost nonexistent, due to a game show that has replaced lawyers and courts to determine criminals' fates. Taryn shows up, saying Quinn can't keep evading the law. A fight erupts, to the delight of the crowd. Taryn arrests Quinn and takes him to the studios, turning him over to \"The Show's\" sleazy producer, Phil (Fredric Lane). Despite Quinn's protests of innocence, Phil puts him on-stage as the other Sliders arrive. Arturo (John Rhys-Davies) is picked to be Quinn's \"advocate,\" or lawyer, as the trial starts."},

"longDescription":"The Sliders land in a barren field outside some small town, primed for another adventure… until they learn that they are stuck on this world for 26 days. Several days later, boredom and frustration set in: Quinn and Colin resort to tinkering with a truck at a deserted gas station. Maggie, the only Slider to have found a paying job in this desolate place, returns from her waitressing job -- she was fired. Rembrandt scavenges some reading material, and as they all relax, he pores over a science fiction novel. He points out some similarities between it and their adventures: inter-dimensional travel, Kromagg-like creatures; and a biological weapon developed to destroy them. Believing that this world may be more interesting than originally thought, Quinn researches the author, but finds he is a recluse who lives up in the mountains. The Sliders find the cabin, and after noticing some activity, knock at the door. Catherine turns them away, but when they reveal they are inter-dimensional travelers, her father, Isaac Clark -- the book's author -- wants to hear their story. After their story is finished, Catherine ridicules them -- but Isaac believes them. After all, he knew Quinn and Colin's parents."},
