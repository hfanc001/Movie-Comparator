"longDescription":"Best-selling comic book artist Joann Sfar delivers an inventive biography of famed French singer Serge Gainsbourg (Eric Elmosnino). Born Lucien Ginsburg to Russian-Jewish parents, Sfar follows Gainsbourg from his childhood in Nazi-occupied Paris to his transition from painter to jazz musician to pop superstar and his many relationships with beautiful women, including Juliette Greco (Anna Mouglalis), Brigitte Bardot (Laetitia Casta) and Jane Birkin (Lucy Gordon). Employing a witty, surrealistic style GAINSBOURG: A HEROIC LIFE also boasts a soundtrack that plays like a time capsule of â€˜60s Paris."}]
