"longDescription":"Set in the land of academia, a place where both Lawrence and Vanessa have taken refuge and plunged themselves into as escape from the external world. In spite of their high IQs, both father and daughter are equally clueless when it comes to navigating relationships. This becomes obvious as Vanessa develops a lineblurring relationship with her uncle, and Lawrence stumbles in romancing his doctor. If Vanessa wants a shot at happiness and Lawrence wants to make things work in his love life, both will have to adopt new attitudes or risk further alienation."},

"description":"Mornings are a madcap time for many of us. We wake up in a haze - often after hitting snooze a few times. Then we rush around to get ready and out the door so we can officially start the day. Before we know it, hours have slipped by without us accomplishing anything beyond downing a cup of coffee, dashing off a few emails, and dishing with our coworkers around the water cooler. By the time the workday wraps up, we're so exhausted and defeated that any motivation to accomplish something in the evening has vanished. <br /><br />But according to time management expert Laura Vanderkam, mornings hold the key to taking control of our schedules. If we use them wisely, we can build habits that will allow us to lead happier, more productive lives. <br /><br />Drawing on real-life anecdotes and scientific research that shows why the early hours of the day are so important, Vanderkam reveals how successful people use mornings to help them accomplish things that are often impossible to take care of later in the day. While many of us are still in bed, these folks are scoring daily victories to improve their health, careers, and personal lives without sacrificing their sanity. For instance, former PepsiCo chairman and CEO Steve Reinemund would rise at 5:00 a.m., run four miles, pray, and eat breakfast with his family before heading to work to run a Fortune 500 company. <br /><br /><i>What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast<\/i> is a fun, practical guide that will inspire you to rethink your morning routine and jump-start your life before the day has even begun."},

"description":"You're going to take a healing journey, and it's going to be great! Unless it's a disaster.... <br /><br />From Stuart Smalley come guided visualizations that will take you to a safe and healing place...except for a few wrong turns along the way. (Stuart made a solemn vow not to edit anything he recorded because he is a perfectionist - that's his problem, but he's owning the problem, and that's okay - and he realized that if he started editing the audio he would never finish it.) <br /><br />So even if some of the parts aren't exactly what Stuart wanted (because human beings aren't perfect, and that's okay), sit back and take a journey down the River of Life and into the Dysfunctional Forest - a dark and scary place where you'll meet Grandiose Bear, Overcommitted Opossum, Sex-aholic Squirrel, and a beautiful little child - a child who looks a lot like...you. Plus, you'll hear Stuart's calming visualizations for such stressful times as traffic jams and holidays. So close your eyes. Relax. You're in good hands. Stuart Smalley is a caring nurturer, a member of several 12-step programs, but not a licensed therapist. <br /><br />Al Franken wants everyone to know that he really created Stuart and played him on <i>Saturday Night Live<\/i>, and that he wrote and performed this program. <br /><br /><b>Warning:<\/b> Do not close eyes while driving a motor vehicle."},

"description":"The third mini-audiobook by the acclaimed author of <i>What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast<\/i> reveals how a few simple changes can make you more productive and fulfilled in your career. In her best-selling mini-audiobook <i>What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast,<\/i> Laura Vanderkam showed us how to take advantage of our often ignored morning hours to achieve our dreams. Then in the sequel, <i>What the Most Successful People Do on the Weekend,<\/i> she revealed why the key to a better week is a better weekend. Now, in the third mini-audiobook of this trilogy, <i>What the Most Successful People Do at Work,<\/i> Vanderkam shows us how to ignite our careers by taking control of our work days. <br /><br />For many of us, the typical workday makes us feel like hamsters on the proverbial wheel. Plagued by crises and distractions, we work hard all day. But when we go home we’re not much closer to reaching our goals. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Vanderkam shows how successful people employ certain daily practices to make sure their work hours are invested, not squandered. Drawing on research and interviews with people as varied as children’s book illustrator LeUyen Pham, productivity guru David Allen, fitness personality Chalene Johnson, and former race car driver Sarah Fisher, Vanderkam shows how to take control of your career by taking control of your nine-to-five."},

"description":"Many of us breathe a grateful TGIF when Friday rolls around, envisioning a weekend full of both productivity and refreshment. Yet too often our precious weekends seem to disappear, eaten up by unproductive work or leisure that fails to energize us. Monday morning comes too fast, finding us still unrested, with too much still undone. Time management expert Laura Vanderkam, continuing her series on What the Most Successful People Do, shows how we can take control of our weekends to get necessary R&amp;R, while also using our downtime as a springboard to a productive week. <br /><br />Drawing on real-life anecdotes and scientific research, Vanderkam explains why doing nothing can be more exhausting than doing something and why happy people make weekend plans in advance. She shares weekend tips gleaned from busy people such as politician and talk show host Mike Huckabee, former CEO Frank Baxter, and TV producer Aliza Rosen. She reveals the kind of weekend activities that make people happiest, explains why it’s important to unplug at least for a little while, and shares the secret of why Sunday night may be the most important part of any weekend. <br /><br /><i>What the Most Successful People Do On the Weekend<\/i> is a fun, practical guide that will inspire you to rethink your weekends and start your workweek refreshed, renewed, and on track."},

In her classic uninhibited style, Kovie deftly weaves through such topics as: being a woman, growing up African, the meaning of beauty, and love. And of course the essay collection includes thoughtful commentary on sociopolitical issues--like race--that Kovie often finds herself discussing in her work. She hopes this audiobook will lend a different side of the story while also encouraging readers to engage in cultural discourse together in a meaningful way."},

"description":"A rare look inside the world of activist hedge funds from one of this country's top investors.<br /><br />In 2002, David Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, gave a speech at a charity investment conference and was asked to share his best investment idea. He described his reasons why Greenlight had sold short the shares of Allied Capital, a leader in the private finance industry. What followed was a firestorm of controversy. <br /><br />Allied responded with a Washington, D.C. style spin-job - attacking Einhorn and disseminating half-truths and outright lies. Undeterred by the spin-job and lies, Greenlight continued its research after the speech and discovered Allied's behavior was far worse than Einhorn ever suspected. <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time<\/i> is the gripping chronicle of this saga, and this edition contains all new updates from the author.<br /><br /> Minute by minute, it delves deep inside Wall Street, showing how the $6-billion hedge fund Greenlight Capital conducts its investment research and detailing the maneuvers of an unscrupulous company. Along the way, you'll witness feckless regulators, compromised politicians, and the barricades our capital markets have erected against exposing misconduct from important Wall Street customers. <br />Goes behind the scenes to detail the truth about investing, short selling, and the politics of businessShows the failings of Wall Street: its investment banks, analysts, journalists, and especially our government regulatorsOffers insights into the battles surrounding hedge fundsReveals the immense difficulties that prevent the government from sanctioning politically connected companies<br />At its most basic level, Allied Capital is the story of Wall Street at its worst. But the story is much bigger than one little-known company. <i>Fooling Some of the People All of the Time<\/i> is an important call for effective law enforcement, free speech, and fair play."},
