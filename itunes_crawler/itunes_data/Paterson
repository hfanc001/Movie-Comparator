"longDescription":"From the producers of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and mind of author Katherine Paterson comes a rousing fantasy adventure about family, friendship, and the wondrous power of imagination. A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), who enters in an \"all boys\" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. Though Jess and Leslie may be considered outcasts by their classmates, their adventures in Terabithia find the pair doing battle against the dreaded Dark Master and his malevolent creatures while plotting revenge against the schoolyard bullies. Now, thanks to his adventures in Terabithia and his friendship with Leslie, Jess finally finds the confidence needed to stand tall and be himself."},

"longDescription":"Tom is a man behaving badly. Restless and impatient, he's involved with an unfeasible number of women and doing his best to drive the clientele away from the Bondi restaurant where he’s the principal chef. Karen plays the traditional long-suffering role of the ex-wife, always on Tom's case to face up to his responsibilities to his eight year old son, Oscar. They both know Oscar would be better off living with her but Tom is determined to keep him, even though he’s moved them out of their beautiful house into a dismal motel. Whatever Tom is up to, his actions seem to be tolerated by those around him. But everything comes to a head as he prepares a party for his son in a beachside park. His anger erupts and Karen finds herself retrieving Oscar from the police station where Tom is being detained. Not much of a birthday. As Tom descends into darkness, fragments of a different story begin to emerge. A chance encounter with an old friend is the trigger for an explanation for his state of mind. He wasn’t always like this. One blissful day ten years ago he met Sarah. She was perfect. Beautiful and sexy, but so much more as well. He was on the brink of success and she inspired him; blessed him and the food he cooked. Made him everything he was and gave him his wonderful son. What happened is hard for Tom to face. All the women in his world are trying in their own, very different, ways to help put him back together. If grief is the price we pay for love, perhaps they – and Oscar - can show Tom it's better to have experienced both than neither."},

The cave of Altamira brings the world together in amazement, drawing people of all types to see the paintings in person. But, Marcelino soon realizes that the art on the walls must be 10,000 years old, earlier than anyone believes possible. The theory threatens to tear Maria and Marcelino’s family apart while the outside world’s astonishment soon turns to fury and fear. The Catholic Church sees his claims as an attack on biblical truth while scientists prove just as dogmatic and reactionary. Maria’s fairytale world grows darker as her family faces disaster and Marcelino’s discovery is repressed. Only their love for each other can guide them toward redemption as Marcelino fights to spread the truth."},
