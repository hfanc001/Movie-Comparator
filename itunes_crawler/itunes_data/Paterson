"longDescription":"From the producers of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and mind of author Katherine Paterson comes a rousing fantasy adventure about family, friendship, and the wondrous power of imagination. A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), who enters in an \"all boys\" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. Though Jess and Leslie may be considered outcasts by their classmates, their adventures in Terabithia find the pair doing battle against the dreaded Dark Master and his malevolent creatures while plotting revenge against the schoolyard bullies. Now, thanks to his adventures in Terabithia and his friendship with Leslie, Jess finally finds the confidence needed to stand tall and be himself."},

"longDescription":"Beatrix Potter was a literary phenomenon of the early 20th Century. At a time when most young women of her class aimed only to make a good marriage, Beatrix became an iconic figure, swimming quietly, but with great fortitude, against the tide. She created a series of books and characters that are as beloved today as they were a hundred years ago, and since their publication they have never been out of print. She was also a distinguished painter and ‚Äì had she been a man ‚Äì her botanical drawings would have been snapped up by the Royal Horticultural Society at Kew Gardens. In addition, by the time she died in 1943, Beatrix Potter had purchased vast swathes of the Lake District that she left to the then fledgling British conservation trust, the National Trust. That so much of this glorious countryside that inspired her, remains as it was in Beatrix Potter‚Äôs day for others to enjoy, is her bequest to the nation. This is her story‚Ä¶"},

"longDescription":"Tom is a man behaving badly. Restless and impatient, he's involved with an unfeasible number of women and doing his best to drive the clientele away from the Bondi restaurant where he‚Äôs the principal chef. Karen plays the traditional long-suffering role of the ex-wife, always on Tom's case to face up to his responsibilities to his eight year old son, Oscar. They both know Oscar would be better off living with her but Tom is determined to keep him, even though he‚Äôs moved them out of their beautiful house into a dismal motel. Whatever Tom is up to, his actions seem to be tolerated by those around him. But everything comes to a head as he prepares a party for his son in a beachside park. His anger erupts and Karen finds herself retrieving Oscar from the police station where Tom is being detained. Not much of a birthday. As Tom descends into darkness, fragments of a different story begin to emerge. A chance encounter with an old friend is the trigger for an explanation for his state of mind. He wasn‚Äôt always like this. One blissful day ten years ago he met Sarah. She was perfect. Beautiful and sexy, but so much more as well. He was on the brink of success and she inspired him; blessed him and the food he cooked. Made him everything he was and gave him his wonderful son. What happened is hard for Tom to face. All the women in his world are trying in their own, very different, ways to help put him back together. If grief is the price we pay for love, perhaps they ‚Äì and Oscar - can show Tom it's better to have experienced both than neither."},

The cave of Altamira brings the world together in amazement, drawing people of all types to see the paintings in person. But, Marcelino soon realizes that the art on the walls must be 10,000 years old, earlier than anyone believes possible. The theory threatens to tear Maria and Marcelino‚Äôs family apart while the outside world‚Äôs astonishment soon turns to fury and fear. The Catholic Church sees his claims as an attack on biblical truth while scientists prove just as dogmatic and reactionary. Maria‚Äôs fairytale world grows darker as her family faces disaster and Marcelino‚Äôs discovery is repressed. Only their love for each other can guide them toward redemption as Marcelino fights to spread the truth."},
