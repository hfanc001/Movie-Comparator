"longDescription":"A young women Jessica, at a party with 300 eye witnesses gets shot at by a young man, for refusing to serve him a drink after closing hours. She is rushed to the hospital and dies of the fatal injury hereafter. While it seems like a straightforward case to begin with, the 300 odd eye witnesses start to back off. Only 7 witnesses are willing to testify against the killer, Manish, putting the case on shaky ground. A high profile TV journalist Meera (Rani Mukerji) from a premier TV channel decides to fight for the truth & starts covering the case. She leads a sting operation exposing that the hostile witnesses were influenced and 'lied' in court."}]
