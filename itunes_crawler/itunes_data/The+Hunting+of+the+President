"longDescription":"The Hunting Of the President: Redux – is an almost complete remake of Harry Thomason and Nickolas Perry’s stunning, incendiary, highly acclaimed original film based on the best selling book by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons.  Filled with new information and completely re-edited, it offers an inside glimpse into how we got here.  It explores all of the previous myths, along with revealing various new myths currently being perpetrated, in what has become a twenty-five year campaign to destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton.  You will hear startling new revelations from people opposing Clinton in his first run for the presidency who soon realized that the extreme right was not only out to destroy the Clintons but didn’t care if democracy itself were destroyed!  \r\n\r\nThese “destroyers of the truth,” are laced with new diabolical lies and disinformation funded by dark, nihilistic and un-American power centers who remain resolute in their continuing effort to malign and destroy the current political world and especially Hillary Clinton. \r\n\r\nSo the question for Americans is not only “How did we get here?” -- but also, “When will it end?”"},
