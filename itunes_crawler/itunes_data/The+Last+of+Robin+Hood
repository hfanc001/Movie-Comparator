"longDescription":"Academy Award®-winning actor Kevin Kline stars as Errol Flynn, one of Hollywood's greatest leading men: a lusty and vivacious actor who lived a swashbuckling life of glamour and scandal on and off the screen. But few remember the icon's last May-December romance that shocked a nation. Joining Kline, Academy Award® winner Susan Sarandon and Dakota Fanning star in this glamorous, gripping story about Errol's high-flying affair with aspiring starlet Beverly Aadland – and how her ambitious mother, Florence, enabled it every step of the way. The Last of Robin Hood is a sensational, unforgettable look at Hollywood's golden age and the desire for fame and acceptance."}]
