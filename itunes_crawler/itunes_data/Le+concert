"longDescription":"On December 10, 2007, Led Zeppelin took the stage at London's O2 Arena to headline a tribute concert for dear friend and Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun.  What followed was a two-hour-plus tour de force of the band's signature blues-infused rock 'n' roll that instantly became part of the legend of Led Zeppelin. Founding members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were joined by Jason Bonham, the son of their late drummer John Bonham, to perform 16 songs from their celebrated catalog including landmark tracks \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"Rock And Roll,\" \"Kashmir\" and \"Stairway To Heaven.\"  A film of the show, Celebration Day, is now available and includes the entire 16 song concert. Celebration Day, directed by Dick Carruthers, is an incredible document of the now legendary concert which has been described as possibly the greatest rock and roll concert ever."},

"longDescription":"When Mumford & Sons discussed the idea of touring South Africa, it struck them as an uncharted, mini adventure. They would announce a handful of gigs and see who showed up. No pressure. 5000 tickets went on sale, 5000 tickets sold out instantly. 85,000 ticket sales later, and the band were embarking on more than a little adventure. Overnight it had become a fully blown phenomena. DUST AND THUNDER chronicles the meeting of South Africa with their long-standing favourites, Mumford & Sons. A British band in huge demand, and a country extremely excited to welcome them. With a coachload of their close musical friends brought along for the ride, this exquisitely shot film captures the tour's conclusion with two nights in the beautiful Pretorian outback. Airing new songs from Wilder Mind and the Johannesburg mini-album (a collaboration with Baaba Maal, The Very Best and Beatenburg) for the first time, and watching the expansive crowds hollering back the old favourites, DUST AND THUNDER gets to the very heart of what makes Mumford & Sons such a special act, with the stunning beauty of the Pretorian outback as their backdrop. Captured with gusto by award-winning live specialist Dick Carruthers, the result is an exciting and emotional document and a truly spectacular concert film that may well go down as their finest."},

His closest friends gathered at London’s Royal Albert Hall to celebrate his life in the only way they knew how – by playing his music. The momentous evening featured George's songs, and music he loved, performed by a lineup that included Clapton, Jools Holland, Jeff Lynne, Paul McCartney, Monty Python, Tom Petty, Billy Preston, Ravi and Anoushka Shankar, Ringo Starr, Dhani Harrison and many more.\n \nDirected by David Leland (Wish You Were Here, HBO’s Band Of Brothers and the Traveling Wilburys video “Handle With Care”), the Grammy® Award-winning CONCERT FOR GEORGE captures stunning renditions of some of the most significant music of the 20th century, including “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” (featuring Clapton on guitar, McCartney on piano and Starr on drums), “Taxman” (performed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) and “The Inner Light” (covered by Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar). Lynne, Harrison’s longtime friend and collaborator, produced the audio elements of the concert, while Clapton oversaw the entire proceedings as Musical Director."},

Director Lance Bangs - who has made videos for the Arcade Fire, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sonic Youth as well as directing R.E.M.'s Road Movie - keeps his small camera crew focused on the stage, getting up close and sweaty with guitarist-singer Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney. Occasionally, he'll pull back to acknowledge the head-bobbing crowd pressed close to the stage, their hands reaching out to Auerbach. There are no visual pyrotechnics, no elaborate editing, no backstage cutaways, yet the show is riveting from start to finish and the feel of the music in that room is nothing less than triumphant."},

"longDescription":"'TIME MACHINE 2011: Live In Cleveland' is an evening with Rush performing their classic hits and features the legendary 'Moving Pictures' album, performed live in its entirety. Released in 1981, 'Moving Pictures' is their most successful album, certified 4x Platinum, and features some of the band's most well known songs and perennial radio favorites, including “Tom Sawyer,” “Limelight” and the Grammy®-nominated instrumental “YYZ.” Captured in April, 2011 in Cleveland during the renowned trio’s extensive world tour, 'TIME MACHINE 2011: Live In Cleveland' marks the band’s first live concert filmed in the United States. The choice to record in Cleveland was a deliberate nod of gratitude to the first city to support Rush on its airwaves, as former WMMS DJ Donna Halper is widely credited for helping break the band in 1974 by spinning “Working Man.” The reinterpreted live version of “Working Man” was the encore closer on the Time Machine tour and is included on this release. In addition to the 26-song concert set, Rush’s notorious concept tour videos are included: The first short film, entitled “The ‘Real’ History of Rush Episode No. 2 ‘Don’t Be Rash,’” and the opening second set video, \"The ‘Real’ History of Rush Episode No. 17 ‘...and Rock and Roll is My Name.'\""},

While the show's centerpiece was a performance of nearly the entire Nevermind tracklist, also noteworthy were early performances of three as yet unrecorded songs which wouldn’t be released until 2 years later on In Utero: \"All Apologies,\" \"Dumb,\" and in its first ever public performance, \"Tourettes.\" The career-spanning setlist also reached back to the band's 1989 Sub Pop debut album, Bleach, for \"Blew,\" \"About A Girl,\" \"School,\" \"Negative Creep\" and first single \"Love Buzz,\" and even further back to the mid-'80s for \"Spank Thru.\" Other songs from the Reading set would appear in studio form on the Incesticide compilation later in the year: \"Aneurysm,\" \"Been A Son\" and \"Sliver.\" Additionally, the band played a pair of beloved covers by two bands that helped shape the formative Nirvana sound– \"The Money Will Roll Right In\" by Fang and \"D-7\" by The Wipers."},

Witness the complete concert for the first time ever."}]
