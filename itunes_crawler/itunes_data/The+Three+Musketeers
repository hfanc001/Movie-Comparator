"description":"<i>The Three Musketeers<\/i> is a swashbuckling story of derring-do. From d’Artagnan’s first meeting with Athos, Portos and Aramis, the Musketeers he so admires, Alexandre Dumas never lets up the pace of his story. His four heroes gallop through the land, trying to foil the murderous plots of the Cardinal and Milady without a thought for their own safety. Dumas depicts the characters with a vivid colour and an energy that brings to life all the fury of their conflicting passions."},
