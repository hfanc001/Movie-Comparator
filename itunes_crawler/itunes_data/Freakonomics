"description":"The <i>New York Times<\/i> best-selling <i>Freakonomics<\/i> changed the way we see the world, exposing the hidden side of just about everything. <br /><br />Now, with <i>Think Like a Freak<\/i>, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems. The topics range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, you’ll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying they’re from Nigeria. <br /><br />Levitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can, too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing - and so much fun to read. <br /><br />Steven D. Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was awarded the John Bates Clark medal, given to the most influential American economist under the age of 40. <br /><br />Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning journalist and radio and TV personality, has worked for <i>The New York Times<\/i> and published three non-<i>Freakonomics<\/i> books."},

"description":"As the blockbuster best-seller <i>Freakonomics<\/i> demonstrated, economics can explain everything - from why people behave the way they do to how governments and businesses organize themselves. But are the basic assumptions and conclusions in <i>Freakonomics<\/i> true? Does the free market usually lead to unintended and negative consequences? Quite the opposite, says John Lott, who holds a Ph.D. in economics. In fact, says Lott, a wide range of fascinating and peculiar case studies prove the simple adage that if something is more costly, people will do less of it. And, in a refutation of <i>Freakonomics'<\/i> most controversial idea, Lott shows why legalized abortion leads to family breakdown, which leads to more crime."},

"description":"Gerd Gigerenzer is one of the researchers of behavioral intuition responsible for the science behind Malcolm Gladwell's bestseller <i>Blink<\/i>. Gladwell showed us how snap decisions often yield better results than careful analysis. Now, Gigerenzer explains why our intuition is such a powerful decision-making tool.<br /> Drawing on a decade of research at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Gigerenzer demonstrates that our gut feelings are actually the result of unconscious mental processes - processes that apply rules of thumb that we've derived from our environment and prior experiences. The value of these unconscious rules lies precisely in their difference from rational analysis - they take into account only the most useful bits of information rather than attempting to evaluate all possible factors. By examining various decisions we make - how we choose a spouse, a stock, a medical procedure, or the answer to a million-dollar game show question - Gigerenzer shows how gut feelings not only lead to good practical decisions but also underlie the moral choices that make our society function.<br /><br /> In the tradition of <i>Blink<\/i> and <i>Freakonomics<\/i>, <i>Gut Feelings<\/i> is an exploration of the myriad influences and factors (nature and nurture) that affect how the mind works, grounded in cutting-edge research and conveyed through compelling real-life examples."},

"description":"The listeners of <i>Freakonomics<\/i> and <i>SuperFreakonomics<\/i> sent the authors of these books countless questions. Many of these questions were regarding various problems and issues that have affected society for a long time. Basically, the listeners wanted the authors of the <i>Freakonomics<\/i> books to research their particular problems and find solutions. The authors and the research team behind the <i>Freakonomics<\/i> books enjoy solving problems for people, but there is only so much that any human can do. Many of the problems that the authors encountered in their letters from listeners were extremely difficult to solve and the mass quantity of questions made it physically impossible to even attempt to answer them all. This problem was contemplated for some time by the <i>Freakonomics<\/i> team and they decided that the solution to this problem was to teach other people how to think like they do. This explains why the book is titled <i>Think like A Freak<\/i>. When the authors are talking about thinking like a freak, they are referring to a person's ability to think about situations like an economist. There is the basic idea that if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, you will feed him for a lifetime. When people understand how to correctly evaluate any situation, they will be more likely to find a plausible solution. <br /><br />Here is a preview of what you'll learn: <br />General Overview and Summary of <i>Think Like A Freak<\/i> Examples From <i>Think Like A Freak<\/i> The Reason <i>Think Like A Freak<\/i> Was Created Learn How To Approach Situations Like An Economist"},
