"longDescription":"The makers of 'The War Room' and 'Don't Look Back,' D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, turn their sights on the competition for the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France (MOF), France's Nobel Prize for pastry. Imagine a scene never before witnessed: Sixteen French pastry chefs gathered in Lyon for three intense days of mixing, piping and sculpting everything from delicate chocolates to six-foot sugar sculptures in hopes of being declared by President Nicolas Sarkozy one of the best. This is the prestigious Meilleurs Ouvriers de France competition (Best Craftsmen in France). 'Forget Masterchef. This is the culinary Hurt Locker.' - Herald Scotland"}]
