"longDescription":"In this action comedy inspired by true events, directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite; Nacho Libre), David Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) discovers the true meaning of adventure far beyond his wildest dreams. He is an uncomplicated man stuck in a monotonous life. Day in and day out he drives an armored vehicle, transporting millions of other people’s money with no escape in sight. The only glimmer of excitement is his flirtatious work crush Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig) who soon lures him into the scheme of a lifetime. Along with a group of half-brained criminals led by Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson) and an absurdly faulted heist plan, David manages the impossible and makes off with $17 million in cash…only problem is he foolishly hands the money over to this wild group of double crossers and has been set up to take the fall. With the bandits blowing the millions on lavish and ridiculous luxuries, they leave behind a glaring trail of evidence. Now on the lam and in over his head, David must dodge the authorities, evade a hilarious hit man, Mike McKinney (Jason Sudeikis), and try to turn the tables on the ones he trusted most.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"A sexy summer weekend turns into a blood-soaked nightmare for a group of college students hunted by blood-thirsty underwater predators in Shark Night 3-D, a terrifying thrill-ride featuring a red-hot young cast. Arriving by boat at her family’s Louisiana lake island cabin, Sara (Sara Paxton) and her friends quickly strip down to their swimsuits for a weekend of fun in the sun. But when star football player Malik (Sinqua Walls) stumbles from the saltwater lake with his arm torn off, the party mood suddenly darkens. Nick (Dustin Milligan), a shy pre-med student, finds himself taking charge—administering first aid and informing Sara they don’t have a minute to spare to get Malik to a hospital on the other side of the lake. Setting out in a tiny speedboat, the college friends quickly discover the lake has been stocked with hundreds of massive, flesh-eating sharks. When the boat malfunctions in mid-trip, marooning them without medical care or a way to call for help, they are shocked to find that it has been deliberately sabotaged. As they face one gruesome attack after another, it becomes frighteningly clear that someone is engineering a deadly plot aimed at killing them all. With their options for rescue dwindling, Sara and the others struggle to fend off the sharks, get help and stay alive long enough to reach the safety of dry land."},

Voluntarily locked away in the perceived safety of a psychiatric hospital, the lone survivor from \"Final Destination\" lives in constant fear that Death is coming to claim her. She may be considered crazy, but she is also right. Death is moving toward suburban Route 23, heading south in \"Final Destination 2.\" Meanwhile, en route to a weekend getaway with her friends, Kimberly Corman has a terrible premonition. Shocked into action, Kimberly blocks traffic on a highway on-ramp. Drivers honk and complain, until death tears up the highway in a massive pile-up, with those left on the on-ramp narrowly escaping with their lives. But Kimberly knows it’s not over: Death won’t be cheated so easily. Now, this random group of strangers, who were all meant to die in the freeway disaster, must join Kimberly in a desperate attempt to stay alive."},

Fueled by curiosity and a dash of naivete, two college buddies return to their ancestral home of Greene, Iowa to figure out how a modest kernel conquered America. With the help of some real farmers, oodles of fertilizer and government aide, and some genetically modified seeds, the friends manage to grow one acre of corn. Along the way, they unlock the hilarious absurdities and scary but hidden truths about America’s modern food system in this engrossing and eye-opening documentary."},

This sensuous, spirited and passionate story is set against a backdrop of war, religious strife and power struggles which tears lives and families apart. In that time, there rises a magnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. Against this backdrop, human dramas and love stories entwine: Tom, the master builder, Aliena, the noblewoman, the sadistic Lord William, Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone work and Ellen, the woman from the forest who casts a curse. At once, this is a sensuous and enduring love story and an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age. Ken Follett masterfully weaves these stories through the political turmoil of 12th century England, creating a relevant and viable world for today's audience and for generations to come."},

In 137 years of organized professional baseball, it’s the only no-hitter tossed while the pitcher was on LSD. Dock was often embroiled in controversy on and off the field. While professional baseball hadn’t fully embraced racial equality, he was an outspoken leader who lived the expression ‘Black is Beautiful!’ His fearlessness enabled him to become one of the most intimidating pitchers of the 70’s and a trailblazer for a new wave of civil rights. After retiring, Dock became as outspoken about his career-spanning substance abuse issues as he had been about intolerance. He spent decades utilizing his brash approach as a counselor, helping other addicts in their recoveries. Through intimate stories and a trove of archival footage, No No: A Dockumentary brings Dock’s vibrant life to light, burnishing the legend and revealing the man behind it."},

"longDescription":"The Pillars of the Earth is a sweeping epic of good and evil, treachery and intrigue, violence and beauty. This sensuous, spirited and passionate story is set against a backdrop of war, religious strife and power struggles which tears lives and families apart. In that time, there rises a magnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. Against this backdrop, human dramas and love stories entwine: Tom, the master builder, Aliena, the noblewoman, the sadistic Lord William, Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone work and Ellen, the woman from the forest who casts a curse. At once, this is a sensuous and enduring love story and an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age. Ken Follett masterfully weaves these stories through the political turmoil of 12th century England, creating a relevant and viable world for today's audience and for generations to come."},
