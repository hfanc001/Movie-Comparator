"shortDescription":"New series focusing on the tumultuous home and professional life of bounty hunter Dwayne \"Dog\" Chapman, and his partner and wife Beth. In the first episode, Dog and team chase Floyd Chapman (no relation), a heavily tattooed bail jumper. After the arrest, Dog, who was once a criminal himself, shares his own personal story with the captured Floyd to try and get him back on the right side of the law.", 
"longDescription":"Welcome to the wonderful and wacky world of Da Kine Bail Bonds - headed by brawny bounty hunter Duane \"Dog\" Chapman and his partner and wife Beth - whose raw and rigorous penchant for getting their guy is only eclipsed by their Honeymooners-style personal antics. Aided by their team of family coworkers who would follow Dog to the end of the earth, the Chapmans always get their guy. Tune in and watch Beth mother her brood of children and chase convicts while in 4 inch heels - see Dog kick fugitive butt but fail to make his 3 year old take a time out. Today we see the Chapman clan defend their family name as they chase down a \"Chapman gone awry\" - Floyd Chapman is a heavily tattooed bail jumper with the same last name as Dog (but no relation). Dog uses his disarming charm in a phone ruse to lure information from the offender?s mom - then rocks his team into a \"state\" of aggressive anticipation to make the surprise bust at the runner?s family home - culminating in a high speed spat with Beth. After an adrenalin pumped grab, Dog, an ex-con turned lawman, shares his personal story with the captured fugitive to try and get him back on the right side of the law. Then they all get to celebrate with a family trip to the beach, just deserts for our bounty hunting heroes and Dog has a chance to contemplate the similarities between the Hawaiian state fish and fugitives."}]
