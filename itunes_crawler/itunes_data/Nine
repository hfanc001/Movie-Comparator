"longDescription":"From visionary filmmakers Tim Burton (The Nightmare Before Christmas) and Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted) and Academy Award-nominated director Shane Acker comes this visually stunning and original epic adventure. In the final days of humanity, a dedicated scientist gives the spark of life to nine of his creations. The world has turned into an unrecognizable landscape of machines and spare parts, but this group of nine finds that if they band together, their small community might just be able to change the course of history. Featuring the voice talents of Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly and Crispin Glover, it’s a thrilling, suspenseful story critics call \"richly imaginative.\" (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone)"},

"longDescription":"\"One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\" -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings -- In the conclusion of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, as armies mass for a final battle that will decide the fate of the world -- and powerful, ancient forces of Light and Dark compete to determine the outcome -- one member of the Fellowship of the Ring is revealed as the noble heir to the throne of the Kings of Men. Yet, the sole hope for triumph over evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood - \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" \"Everything is Illuminated\"), who, accompanied only by his loyal friend Sam and the hiddeous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power. Also starring Academy Award-nominee Viggo Mortensen (\"A History of Violence,\" \"Eastern Promises\"), Academy Award-nominee and Golden Globe-winner Ian McKellan (\"X-Men,\" TV's \"Rasputin\"), Orlando Bloom (\"Troy,\" \"The Pirates of the Caribbean” trilogy), Liv Tyler (\"The Strangers\" \"The Incredible Hulk\") and Academy Award and Golden Globe-winner Cate Blanchett (\"Elizabeth,\" \"The Aviator\"). Winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director!"},

"longDescription":"Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay marks the triumphant return of these two hilarious, slacker anti-heroes. The movie stars John Cho (American Pie I & II, American Dreamz) as Harold and Kal Penn (Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj, Epic Movie) as Kumar, two stoners who can't seem to get a break. Their last adventure found them traveling across country to find a White Castle hamburger in order to satisfy a weed-induced case of \"the munchies.\" This time, the boys get themselves in trouble trying to sneak a bong on board a flight to Amsterdam. Now, being suspected of terrorism, they are forced to run from the law and try to find a way to prove their innocence. What follows is an irreverent and epic journey of deep thoughts, deeper inhaling and a wild trip around the world that is as \"un-PC\" as it gets."},
