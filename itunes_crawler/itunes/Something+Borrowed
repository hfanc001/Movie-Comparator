"longDescription":"Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a generous and loyal pal to her engaged best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson). But after celebrating her 30th birthday, perpetual good girl Rachel unexpectedly ends up in the arms of Dex (Colin Egglesfield), the guy she’s had a crush on since law school…and who happens to be Darcy’s fiancé. In the frantic weeks leading up to Darcy’s wedding, Rachel finds herself caught between her long-time friendship with Darcy and the prospect of losing the love of her life. Based on Emily Giffin’s bestseller, this funny and touching romantic comedy also stars John Krasinski as Rachel’s constant confidante and conscience, who busily evades the affection of one of Darcy’s lovestruck friends while harboring a secret crush of his own."},
