"longDescription":"A mysterious object plummets to Earth, sending out a shock wave that causes five strangers to perish, only to miraculously come back to life moments later. The group includes Vera (Shantel VanSanten), a struggling radio-astronomer searching for her missing son; Erin (Sofia Black-D'Elia), a young mother desperate to protect her seven year old daughter (guest star Madison Dellamea) from an abusive ex-husband (guest star Lane Garrison); Peter (Joel Courtney), a troubled high school student; Raul (JD Pardo), a federal agent looking to escape his dangerous and violent undercover assignment; and Joshua (Jon Fletcher), a charismatic second-generation televangelist. Most mysterious of all is the figure known only as The Man (Diogo Morgado), who offers Vera the one thing she wants most in life - if she will help him with one morally complicated task which puts her on a collision course with Rose (Anna Diop), a nurse who has been in a coma for seven years. Drawn together by fate and biblical prophecy, the \"Messengers\" soon learn they have supernatural gifts that might be the only hope for preventing the impending Rapture. Craig Frank also stars."},
