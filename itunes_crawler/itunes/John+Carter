"longDescription":"The year is 2018. An army of Terminators roams the post-apocalyptic landscape, killing or collecting humans. But small groups of survivors have organized into a Resistance, hiding in underground bunkers and striking when they can. Controlling the Terminators is the artificial intelligence network Skynet, which became self-aware 14 years earlier and, in the blink of an eye, turned on its creators, unleashing nuclear annihilation on an unsuspecting world. The world is on the brink of the future that John Connor (Christian Bale) has been warned about all his life. But something totally new has shaken his belief that humanity stands a chance of winning this war: the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger from the past. Connor must decide whether Marcus can be trusted. But as Skynet adapts new strategies to end the Resistance forever, Connor and Marcus must find common ground to take a stand against the onslaught--to infiltrate Skynet and meet the enemy head-on."},

John Cusack (Being John Malkovich) stars as Rob Gordon, the owner of a semi-failing record store located on one of the back streets of Chicago. He sells music the old-fashioned way -- on vinyl, with two wacky clerks, the hysterically funny rock snob Barry (Jack Black) and the more quietly opinionated underachiever Dick (Todd Louiso). But Rob's business isn't the only thing in his life that's floundering -- his needle skips the love groove when his longtime girlfriend Laura (newcomer Iben Hjejle) walks out on him. And this forces him to examine his past failed attempts at romance the only way he knows how! For a rocking fun time, give High Fidelity a spin. It's sure to make your all-time top five list for comedies -- with a bullet."},

"longDescription":"A classic tale of redemption, this film features a volatile coach and a former star player-turned alcoholic leading a small-town basketball team on an improbable run to the Indiana high school championship game. Coach Norman Dale encounters several hurdles in his path: a feisty teacher determined to keep the best player from going out for the team, a town chock full of second-guessing fathers, and a group of undisciplined athletes. Story inspired by the Milan (Indiana) Indians' state title of 1954. Nominated for two Oscars and hailed by Sports Illustrated and ESPN as one of the best sports movies of all time, this triumphant tale of a high school basketball team's long-shot attempt to win the state features \"fast-break cinematography” that catches the pace of the game.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

"longDescription":"In 1553, England's idle rich were anything but idle. With the blessing of the royal family, they plundered the riches of the church, stole the finest farmlands, and generally took all the best things the country had to offer. A cousin to the infamous Henry VII, Lady Jane Grey disapproved of the way her fellow nobles behaved, and disagreed with their religious beliefs.  But as a sheltered 16-year-old, there wasn't much she could do about it. Then, through a strange turn of events, Lady Jane Grey was crowned Queen Jane, ruler of all England.  Based on the true story of the girl who found herself Queen of England for nine days at age 16, Lady Jane is a historical romance at its bittersweet best. Look for Patrick Stewart as Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk."},

His marriage is soon to be on the rocks, and he's out of touch with his son Jed and young teenage daughter Abby. One night, Abby runs away from home and our abductor grabs her, blindfolds her, and locks her in his basement with the others. He's not a serial killer – instead, he's been abducting women to start a family. When Mike learns of Abby's abduction, he puts the facts together and realizes he doesn't have much time.

"longDescription":"John Carpenter's Halloween scared the living daylights out of 25 million people and set a precedent in smashing box office records for a horror film. But the nightmare is just beginning... Picking up precisely where its predecessor left off, Halloween II follows the same ill-fated characters as they encounter the knife-wielding maniac they left for dead in the first Halloween. It seems the inhuman Michael Myers is still very much alive and out for more revenge as he stalks the deserted halls of the hospital where his sister lays waiting. As he gets closer and closer to his terrified target, Dr. Loomis discovers the chilling mystery behind the crazed psychopath's savage actions. Written by horror masters John Carpenter and Debra Hill, Halloween II is a spine-tingling dark ride into the scariest night of the year."},

Both are cultured intellectuals with an all-embracing passion for music, literature and science, who have evolved to a level where they no longer kill for sustenance, but still retain their innate wildness. Their love story has endured several centuries but their debauched idyll is threatened by the uninvited arrival of Eve’s carefree little sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) who hasn’t yet learned to tame her wilder instincts. Driven by sensual photography, trance-like music, and droll humor, Jim Jarmusch’s Only Lovers Left Alive is a meditation on art, science, and the mysteries of everlasting love."},

When Master Vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) decimates Jack's entire team, Crow and the sole team survivor, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), set out in pursuit. Breaking all the rules, Crow and Montoya take one of Valek's victims hostage.
