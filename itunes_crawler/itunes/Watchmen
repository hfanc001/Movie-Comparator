"longDescription":"\"Watchmen (Director's Cut)\" promises 24 extra minutes of action-packed, effects-laden scenes never before seen in theaters! This multi-layered adventure unfolds as scenes present in the graphic novel finally make the leap to film. A complex, multi-layered mystery adventure, \"Watchmen\" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the Doomsday Clock--which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union--moves closer to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion--a disbanded group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers--Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the Watchmen?"},
