"description":"The creators of The Spiderwick Chronicles leave the old-fashioned charm of New England far behind and head south for some fiendish faerie fun in the hot Florida sun.<br /> Eleven-year-old Nicholas Vargas thinks his sucky life has been turned upside down. His developer father has remarried and moved his new wife and daughter into his home in the soon-to-be-completed Melgrove Hollow. So, not only has Nick lost his bedroom to his wacko new step-sister, Laurie (who lugs around this huge book about faeries and wishes her name was Lauranathana...C'mon! How lame is that?!), but his father actually wants him to spend time with her.<br /><br /> When an \"expedition\" to a nearby lake turns up a nixie with a giant problem - and by giant we're talkin' the huge, lumbering, fire-breathing variety - it's up to Nick and Laurie (with the help of Nick's big brother, Julian) to figure out the best way to stop the rampaging beast before all of Mangrove Hollow goes up in smoke!"},

As hard as it was for us to believe, we came to see that there was no alternative explanation. Now, putting aside personal concerns, we bring their stories to you.<br /> In <i>The Field Guide<\/i>, twins Jared and Simon and their older sister, Mallory, aren't all that impressed with the ramshackle old mansion their mother moves them to when their decidedly kooky Great Aunt Lucinda is sent to an asylum. But a series of mysterious events within the house leads the three young Graces to an old book filled with hand drawn pictures of all kinds of fantastic creatures. Jared believes the book holds the key to all the freaky goings on (for which he has been blamed).<br /><br /> In <i>The Seeing Stone<\/i>, the Grace kids are just beginning to get used to Aunt Lucinda's strange old mansion when Simon disappears. At first, Mallory thinks that her younger bother Simon is pulling some kind of prank. But when it becomes obvious that he's been snatched by goblins, Jared and his sister have to rely on the help of a mischevious house boggart, a nasty bridge troll, and a loud mouthed hobgoblin to get him back!"},

And will the Grace kids be left alone now that the Guide has mysteriously disappeared? To make matters even worse, now Mallory has vanished and something foul in the water is killing off all the plants and animals for miles around.
