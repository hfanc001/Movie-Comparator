"longDescription":"After a high-speed freeway chase puts Madea (Tyler Perry) in front of the judge, her reprieve is short-lived as anger management issues get the best of her and land her in jail. A gleeful Joe (Tyler Perry) couldn't be happier at Madea's misfortune. But Madea's eccentric family members the Browns (David and Tamala Mann) rally behind her, lending their special \"country\" brand of support. Meanwhile, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Hardaway (Derek Luke) is on the fast track to career success. But Hardaway lands a case too personal to handle - defending young prostitute and former drug addict Candace Washington (Keshia Knight Pulliam) - and asks his fianc√©e and fellow ADA Linda Holmes (Ion Overman) to fill in on his behalf. When Candace ends up in jail, Madea befriends the young woman, protecting her in a \"motherly\" way as only Madea can.", "hasITunesExtras":true},
