With one phone call, Lenny can make the red tape disappear. But as Lenny's right-hand man Archy (Mark Strong) tells him, London is ground zero for the changing times, with big-time mobsters from the East, hungry criminals from the streets, and everyone in-between, all vying to change the rules of commerce and crime. With millions up for grabs, all of London's criminal underworld conspires, colludes and collides with one another in an effort to take their cut. But as high rollers and petty criminals alike jockey for dominance, the true prize of one multi-million-dollar deal will fall into the hands of a junkie rock star (Toby Kebbell) - Lenny's stepson, presumed dead but very much alive."},

But when she is brutally raped by a group of sadistic rednecks, Jennifer has plans for more than mere revenge. One-by-one she will find them and will inflict horrific acts of agonizing torment upon them. And no jury in America would ever convict her. Jeff Branson (TV’s ALL MY CHILDREN), Daniel Franzese (BULLY), Rodney Eastman (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 & 4), Chad Lindberg (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS), and Tracey Walter (THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) co-star in this graphic, shocking and undeniably disturbing new take on one of the most controversial films of all time."},

"longDescription":"This critically acclaimed Sundance breakout is hailed as one of the best horror films of the year. Tormented by an unknown entity, a young couple fights to survive a road trip-turned-nightmare when they’re trapped in a claustrophobic backwoods maze on a dark road. On one of their first dates, Tom (Iain De Caestecker of TV’s AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D) and Lucy (Alice Englert of BEAUTIFUL CREATURES) drive to a music festival in a remote countryside village. But when they leave the main road to look for their hotel they quickly become hopelessly lost. Misleading road signs send them in circles and soon night sets in. As their anxiety escalates they discover they are not alone, and this sadistic game spirals into a white-knuckle ride for survival. Costars Allen Leech (TV’s DOWNTON ABBEY, THE IMITATION GAME)."},
