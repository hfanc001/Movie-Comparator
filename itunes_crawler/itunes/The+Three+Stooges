"longDescription":"Calling all knuckleheads! From the fiercely funny Farrelly Brothers (There’s Something About Mary) comes this contemporary take on the world’s most beloved classic comedy trio...The Three Stooges! Left on the doorstep of a nun-conventional orphanage as toddlers, Moe, Larry, and Curly grow up eye-poking, face-slapping and head-clunking their way into adulthood. Now the bumbling trio — pure of heart, but dim of wit — find themselves on a madcap mission to save their childhood home from foreclosure. Can the Stooges survive the modern world, raise the money, and ultimately save the day? Why soitenly!"},
