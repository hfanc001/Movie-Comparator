When the Royal Jelly is stolen, the hornets are the prime suspects and Maya is thought to be their accomplice. Now, it's up to Maya and all of her new friends to prove her innocence and find the missing Royal Jelly!\r\n\"In the same vein as FINDING NEMO and ANTZ...this is a story about adventure, self-discovery, tolerance and friendship.\" (WeekendNotes.com)"},

Armed with a fetching superhero costume, Underdog vows to protect the beleaguered citizens of Capital City and, in particular, a beautiful spaniel named Polly Purebred. When a diabolical plot by Barsinister and his overgrown henchman Cad threatens to destroy Capital City, only Underwear... (oops!)...Underdog can save the day.

"longDescription":"Ray Bradbury’s best-selling science fiction masterpiece about a future without books takes on a chillingly realistic dimension in this film classic directed by one of the most important screen innovators of all time, the late François Truffaut . Julie Christie stars in the challenging dual role of Oskar Werner's pleasure-seeking conformist wife, Linda, and his rebellious, book-collecting mistress, Clarisse. Montag (Oskar Werner), a regimented fireman in charge of burning the forbidden volumes, meets a revolutionary school teacher who dares to read. Suddenly he finds himself a hunted fugitive, forced to choose not only between two women, but between personal safety and intellectual freedom. Truffaut's first English language production is an eerie fable where mankind becomes the ultimate evil."},
