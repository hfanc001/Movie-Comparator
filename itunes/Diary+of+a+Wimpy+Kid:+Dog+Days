"description":"Greg Heffley and his family hit the road in author-illustrator Jeff Kinney's latest installment of the phenomenal best-selling Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. A family road trip is supposed to be a lot of fun… unless, of course, you’re the Heffleys. The journey starts off full of promise, then quickly takes several wrong turns. Gas station bathrooms, crazed seagulls, a fender bender, and a runaway pig - not exactly Greg Heffley’s idea of a good time. But even the worst road trip can turn into an adventure - and this is one the Heffleys won’t soon forget."}]
