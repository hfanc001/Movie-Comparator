But Zoey doesn’t share the damning evidence: a photo that Jackie used to make a fake ID, while blaming a dying patient for stealing Dr. Roman’s DEA number. Meanwhile, Jackie sleeps with Eddie. When Jackie gets to work the next morning, Akalitus orders her to submit to drug testing, or admit that she’s using drugs and enter a ‘diversion program,’ which involves rehab, probation, and a major pay cut. Jackie, ever-defiant, won’t admit a thing. Akalitus tells Jackie if she fails the drug test, she will be stripped of her license and will not be able to practice medicine again. Jackie tries to convince Coop that it was Carrie’s incompetence that almost cost a patient’s life. When Coop confronts Carrie, she takes full responsibility and also tells Coop she’s pregnant with his child. Desperate now, Jackie confronts Zoey, but Zoey won’t back down. She tells Jackie that she will hand over the damning fake ID photo if Jackie doesn’t go to rehab. Akalitus calls Jackie to take the drug test, and Jackie flees the hospital. She stops at Kevin’s apartment to ask her daughters to spend the afternoon with her, but Grace tells Jackie off.  Jackie uses drugs and hits the road – with a suitcase full of pills that Eddie gives her. But as she’s rushing to catch a flight out of New York, she sees a car accident. Her nursing instincts take over, and she helps the injured motorist. When paramedics arrive on the scene, Jackie gets back in her car and drives off – right into an ambulance. The pills in her suitcase go flying. Cops point flashlights into her car and see the drugs. And then, they arrest Jackie Peyton."},
