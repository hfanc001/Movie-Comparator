"description":"In the small Connecticut town of Wilshire, James Corbett, senior member of a local outlaw family, has been hideously murdered. For Ellen Wilder, new editor and owner of the local newspaper, the gruesome killing is as disturbing as the irrational fears it has triggered within her. She is left doubting for her own sanity. For State Police Detective Michael Chandler, the murder is only a hint of trouble to come... and an eerie echo of his own near-death experience. <br /><br />But nothing could have prepared anyone in the rational world for the return of Franny Corbett. A hulking child of a man, the blackest sheep in a black sheep family, his eerie presence may have ushered in a final endgame of violence, fear, and unearthly events in this bizarre Connecticut village. Soon Wilshire will be shaken again. A car sunk just beneath the surface of a local lake is soon to rise... and with it a trip into the other side of the human existence...."},
