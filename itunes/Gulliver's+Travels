"description":"Set and written in 1726, This is a marvelously imaginative tale of the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver. He finds himself shipwrecked and the prisoner of captors ranging in size from 6 inches tall to 60 feet tall and of various other persuasions. But this is just the beginning of a story written, strangely enough to satirize the foolishness and vices of modern men as they were perceived at the time. No one, young or old, can ever forget the Lilliputians and the Yahoos that starred in these wonderful and riveting stories of long ago. <br /><br /> Jonathan Swift (1667¿1745) was an Irish novelist, satirist, poet and political essayist. From a very literary family, his uncle married the daughter of a godson of William Shakespeare, Swift was very well educated, receiving an MA from Oxford University and a Doctorate in Divinity from Trinity College in Dublin. <br /><br /> An ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland, Swift began writing satire, inspired by his misery in his profession. Politically active, Swift incurred the enmity of enough British nobles, that his career as a minister was over. Swift began writing novels, while also writing political pamphlets promoting Irish causes. <br /><br /> Swift's best known work, <i>Gulliver's Travels<\/i> is filled with satiric references to his current events, and was an immediate hit, written anonymously, it had to be smuggled into Ireland. The Queen was not amused."},

"description":"In <i>Gulliver's Travels<\/i>, the narrator represents himself as a reliable reporter of the fantastic adventures he has just experienced. But how far can we rely on a narrator who has been impersonated by someone else? The work purports to be a travel book, and describes the shipwrecked Gulliver's encounters with the inhabitants of four extraordinary places: Lilliput, Brobdingnag, Laputa, and the country of the Houyhnhnms. A consumately skillful blend of fantasy and realism makes <i>Gulliver's Travels<\/i> by turns hilarious, frightening, and profound. This is one of literature's most disturbing satires on the human condition."},

"description":"Gulliver's Travels has been in print since its first publication in 1726, due to its popularity with young and old alike. As well as a wildly imaginative tale of travel and adventure, it is a comment on human nature and an overblown explorer's story, rich in symbolism and humour. Lemuel Gulliver, an English surgeon, sets sail on expeditions to extraordinary worlds. He is twelve times larger than the inhabitants of Liliput, who recruit him into their military, and equally as small to the people of Brobdingnag.<br /><br />His journeys grow more and more strange. Satirical and absurd in its twists and turns, which invariably see Gulliver either fleeing or ejected by the strange tribes of people he meets, this CSA WORD production will be a welcome addition to any audio collection. Now an epic film starring Jack Black and Emily Blunt."},

"description":"Part I : A Voyage to Lilliput and Blefuscu: Gulliver enjoys traveling, although it is this love of travel that is his downfall. His adventure sets off in Lilliput, when after a shipwreck, he wakes up, finding himself a prisoner of a race of people one 12th the size of normal human beings. However, his adventure among the small people does not last long, when he has to escape the city as he is charged with treason. <br /><br />Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag: This time around Gulliver finds himself in the land of the giants, and he is one twelfth their size. The people of Brobdingnag, find Gulliver amusing, as he is really small as compared to them, and exhibit Gulliver for money. However, Gulliver soon finds himself in the middle of the sea again, when a giant eagle seizes him and drops him right into the sea where he is picked up by some sailors. <br /><br />Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan: After Gulliver's ship is attacked by pirates, he is marooned close to a desolate rocky island, near India. Fortunately he is rescued by the flying island of Laputa, a kingdom devoted to the arts of music and mathematics but unable to use them for practical ends. Gulliver is then taken to Balnibarbi to await a Dutch trader who can take him on to Japan. While waiting for passage, Gulliver takes a short sidetrip to the island of Glubbdubdrib, where he visits a magician's dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures. When Gulliver finally returns home, he is determined to stay there for the rest of his days. <br /><br />Part IV: A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms: Despite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to the sea as the captain of a merchantman. However, as expected he lands himself into trouble, and he comes first upon a race of (apparently) hideous deformed and savage humanoid creatures called Yahoos, who are ruled by a race of horses called Houyhnhms.

"description":"Four-time Emmy Award winner David Hyde Pierce is famous for playing the lovably self-important Dr. Niles Crane in the hit TV series Frasier. Now, he brings the same wit and charming arrogance to his Signature Classics performance of Jonathan Swift’s <i>Gulliver’s Travels<\/i>.<br /><br />More than just a mock travel book and fabulous adventure, <i>Gulliver’s Travels<\/i> is a character study and social satire that skewers politics, science, religion, philosophy, and pretentiousness with a bite and resonance that remains as fresh today as the day it was published. Maybe that’s why it hasn’t been out of print in nearly 300 years.<br /><br />Set sail with David Hyde Pierce for a smart, fun, new <i>Gulliver’s Travels<\/i> experience that’s unlike any other. And stay tuned for more one-of-a-kind performances from actors Leelee Sobiesky, Casey Affleck, Tim Curry, and more, only from Audible Signature Classics."},

It's also a parody on traveller's tales, as Jonathan Swift chronicles the voyages to Lilliput, Brobingnag, and other fantastical destinations in this powerful 18th-century masterpiece. Simon Cadell reads with a sure touch and great understanding of his subject."},

His most famous visits are to Lilliput, where he towers over the 6-inch, warlike people, and Brobdingnag, where the natives are gigantic, yet cannot understand abstract concepts. Gulliver also travels to the flying island of Laputa, Lagadu, a land of impractical philosophers, and Glubdubdrib, where sorcerers allow him to speak to great historical figures. He meets the Struldbrugs, who are miserable immortals, and visits Houyhnhnmland, where a race of highly intelligent horses are served by filthy creatures called Yahoos. Filled with brilliant satire and wild encounters, Jonathan Swift's masterpiece is one of the most creative, significant novels of all time."},

"description":"Irish writer Jonathan Swift was trained for the Church, but for many years did not achieve a suitable post. He supported himself as a private secretary. The break came with the publication of <i>Tale of a Tub<\/i>, published in 1704, when he was 37. He continued to make a living from minor Church positions but increasingly gained recognition for his writing. Swift went to England as a political journalist for the Tories, but when George I died in 1714, he returned to Ireland, much scorned.

"description":"Lemuel Gulliver, a slightly staid ship’s doctor, relates the tales of his astonishing travels. He encounters the tiny, warring Lilliputians; the giant, sceptical Brobdingnagians; the ludicrously intellectual Laputans; and the idealistic – if rather stolid – Houyhnhnms and their bestial servants, the Yahoos. An immediate best-seller when it was first published in 1726, <i>Gulliver’s Travels<\/i> has remained a favourite ever since. It was an attack on the politics and society of Swift’s day, but it is also a polemical, inventive, surreal, vitriolic and wonderfully imaginative masterpiece, whose powerful satire continues to strike home."},

"description":"Jonathan Swift's classic novel about the loveable Lemuel Gulliver is one that is taught in high schools around the country, and for good reason. Gulliver, who is a surgeon aboard a ship, thinks that he is about to embark on a run-of-the-mill voyage to different ports. Throughout his journey, however, there are a few events that take place that redirect his ship to unfamiliar islands. Not only are they unfamiliar to him, but they are inhabited by natives who are shaped and sized much differently than he is. His mistaken voyage to the island of Lilliput, for instance, yields an encounter with the miniature Lilliputians, who are only six inches tall. The second voyage, by contrast, causes him to have a run-in with a band of giants, who capture him when the other members of his fleet escape. <br /><br />Despite the seemingly unfortunate events that befall him on the high seas, Gulliver learns important lessons throughout the encounters with these strange people. Spread out over four books in total, Swift's classic is written as a parody and satire of the sailor's tales that were popularized years ago. <i>Gulliver's Travels<\/i> concludes each book with a heart-warming return to his beloved England, and Gulliver is a changed man because of it."},
