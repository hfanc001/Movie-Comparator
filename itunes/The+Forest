"longDescription":"Life in the Army will never be the same after an unforgettable wake up call from Academy Award® winner Robin Williams (Best Supporting Actor, Good Will Hunting, 1997) in this smash hit comedy. Williams delivers a tour-de-force performance in the role critics agree he was born to play – legendary armed forces radio deejay Adrian Cronauer. Deployed to Saigon to host a morning radio show during the Vietnam War, Cronauer’s sidesplitting antics and rapid-fire wit make him an instant hit with the troops in the field but soon get him in hot water with his by-the-book superiors. An unforgettable supporting cast and a red-hot soundtrack of ‘60s hits make this the quintessential Robin Williams comedy."},

This is Amin's incredible story as seen through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scotsman who becomes the volatile leader's personal physician. Due in part to Amin's unexpected passion for Scottish culture, Amin even proclaims himself \"The Last King of Scotland\". Seduced by Amin's charisma and blinded by decadence, Garrigan's dream life becomes a waking nightmare of betrayal and madness from which there is no escape. Inspired by real people and events, this gripping, suspenseful stunner is filled with performances you will never forget."},
