And a one-square-mile neighborhood in Boston, called Charlestown, has produced more bank robbers than anywhere in the U.S. One of them is Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), the leader of a crew of ruthless bank robbers who pride themselves on taking what they want and getting out clean. The only family Doug has are his partners in crime, especially Jem (Jeremy Renner), the closest thing Doug ever had to a brother. Things change when Jem takes a blindfolded hostage: bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). After the job, Doug seeks out Claire, who has no idea that this charming stranger is one of the men who terrorized her only days before. As his relationship with Claire deepens into a passionate romance, Doug wants out of this life and the town. But with the Feds, led by Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm), closing in and Jem questioning his loyalty, Doug realizes that getting out will not be easy and, worse, may put Claire in the line of fire.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

Perennially upbeat Ned (Paul Rudd of I LOVE YOU MAN, DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS, 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN), an erstwhile organic farmer, is utterly lacking in common sense. After his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off their farm, Ned turns to his sisters, who once again come to his rescue, each taking a turn housing their troublemaker sibling. Ned's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines, but as the sisters' lives begin to unravel, they come to realize that maybe, in his steadfast optimism, Ned isn't such an idiot after all."},
